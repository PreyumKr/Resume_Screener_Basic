Data Science Consultant
Deloitte — New York, IL
© Created a recommendation engine for an educational Startup with job descriptions from Indeed, Glassdoor and
Linkedin using content-based filtering methods, reaching more than 200 users when writing their resume
© Using python libraries pre-processed and cleaned more than 1 million records of sentences to build a MongoDB
database: resulting in 30% reduction in preprocessing
o Applied DistillBert to generate contextual word embeddings for job description and the sentences, which lead to 60%
improvement in speed when compared against BERT, while retaining 97% of the semantic capacities of BERT
© Successfully filtered correct sentences for each missing skill in a resume with cosine similarity score range of 0.87 to
0.98
© Converted sentences into their past tense using pyinflect NLP library in Spacy and achieved 80% grammatical
accuracy using gingerit
© Collaborated with team members within an agile framework for increased efficiency

Twitter Image Extraction
© Designed an algorithm for a digital marketing company that leverages the power of Tweets to achieve marketing, and
branding goals for their clients; increased ROI by 45%
© Built and automated a pipeline using twitter API tweepy to extract tweets, location, images, and videos from twitter
based on a particular hashtag; a 50% sise in tweepy performance by error identification, debugging and filtering
0 Launched an AWS RDS database for storing the scraped twitter information in form a table using PostgreSQL.
© Deployed the algorithm on the AWS server using $3 bucket triggered lambda function which would run the python
script to collect information on a requested hashtag
