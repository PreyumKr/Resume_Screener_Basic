LEAD MECHANICAL ENGINEER, DESIGN AUTOMATION TEAM (2009 — Present)

Develop and drive in-house mechanical design programs for rotating and stationary components of electric machines,
from 1,000 HP to 60,000 HP. Partner across multiple internal teams and external suppliers. Play pivotal role in

 

designing new product offerings and enhancing existing products. Guide oe

team in key projects and initiatives. Oversee and mentor engineering ;

interns, leading to many hired at GE and 1 receiving corporate award. ¢ ere ee
¢ Accelerated project delivery by heading development and REGUL TTR ati cts

 

release of a suite of engineering and CAD tools aligned with parallel

flow ventilation design methodology.
- Automated models, drawings, and BOMs by including 40+ subroutines, fully- integrated with CAD
tools, as well as procedures to test software across all product >

lines. ¢
¢ Catapulted efficiency by spearheading generation of automated dee eRe a alae)
drawing packages; yielded release of 6 engineering design standards " streamlined engineer-
with updated stator flange design calculations and parametric design to-order design cycle.

 

package for engineering, CAD, and BOM.
¢ Diagnosed and rectified 19,000 HP GE motor failure at customer gas plant in 1 month with safe,
temporary solution. Steered project to assess feasibility and implement 25,000 HP spare motor from
customer’s alternate site while coordinating engineering functions among 5 companies.
- Directed review of test validations and machining modifications, definition of functional specification
for coupling adapter, and evaluation of train torsional analysis; composed customer technical report.

MECHANICAL ENGINEER, REQUISITION DESIGN TEAM (2004 — 2009)

Designed a variety of machines from order to remittance, including reciprocating compressors, low-speed grinding
mills, and waterwheel generator, from 1,150 HP to 30,000 HP. Sized shaft-bearing systems, performed rotor dynamic
analysis, and conducted 3D modeling and finite element analysis of structural ae

components. Participated in growth initiatives and special projects.

¢ Paved the way for designs incorporated into Stator Frame Est: Reels mi ol-tg
Engineering Design Standards. Managed conversion of reciprocating hi 35K
compressor motor product line from pedestal to bracket bearing. cena i :
- Leveraged ANSYS for modal analysis; guided creation of 24
bracket bearing designs for 3 motor frame sizes, including lifting analysis on motor static structures
via finite element analysis and hand calculations.
¢ Delivered low-speed generator barring torques, overcoming fluid film in design, which prevented
low-speed barring without jacking oil system. Modified bearing liners to accept injected high-pressure oil.
- Calculated lift-off pressure and steady state pressure; sized pump motor; supplied jacking oil unit
functional specification; included interfaces between jacking oil unit and bearing in design.
¢ Engineered rotor design for single-bearing, direct-coupled, 300 RPM, 11,000 HP reciprocating
compressor motor requiring avoidance of torsional resonance conditions and system inertia maintenance to
limit motor current pulsations to customer specification. Pioneered torsional solution.
¢ Brought machine balance grade in line with ISO 1940-1-2003 standards, resulting in project’s
methodology and design principles adopted for future orders. Determined acceptable residual unbalance and
designed custom balance weights to mount to rotor spider for validating balance grade during testing.
