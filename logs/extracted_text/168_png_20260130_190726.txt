Summary
Tam a graduate from Sokoine University of Agriculture with Bachelor of Science in Horticulture, my passion lies in empowering
farmers and igniting economic growth through the power of agriculture. I firmly believe that by equipping small scale farmers with
the necessary tools, knowledge and resources, we can create a sustainable and prosperous farming community,

Throughout my academic journey, Ihave developed a comprehensive understanding of horticultural practices, including crop
cultivation, pest management, soil fertility, and efficient farming techniques.

Together we can create a vibrant and resilient agricultural landscape that not only contributes to the economy but also foster

sustainable development for future generation.
