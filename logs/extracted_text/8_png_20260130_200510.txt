EXPERIENCE

 

06/2020 to Current Data Science Intern
Motorola Solutions — Columbia, MD
Performed data preprocessing on MIMIC3 dataset using Natural Language Tool Kit to transform unstructured data to a
state where the features of the data can now be easily interpreted by the algorithm.
Trying to find meaning full insights from the text (prescriptions) and connect them to ICD9 codes to find high risk
patients,

01/2020 to Current Data Science Intern
Motorola Solutions — Fort Myers, FL

‘* Extracted Data from cloud by API calls to the AERSMIne- a novel framework for FAERS data mining by
analyzing 13+ million Patients records.

‘Selected Preprocessed and transformed the data related to Type 2 diabetes mellitus patients into a form( X-Y
matrix) that can be used to train a Machine learning algorithm.

* Calculated the feature importance score for all the features and eliminated the features with least importance to
avoid the over fitting problem.

‘* Built a regression model that could predict the cause for the adverse events in these patients- co-indications and
drugs.

‘* Developed a Machine learning model using Linear SVC classifier that predicts the Obligation Category for the
statements in a Statement of Work document with 87.79 percent accuracy. First the pre-processing is performed
where stop words are removed followed by normalization and then model is built using Linear SVC classifier.
‘* Written complex queries using Oracle SQL
