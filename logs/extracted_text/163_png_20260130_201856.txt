ACADEMIC PROJECTS

+ "Processing Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE) experiment” Dec 2017 Determined the
complex wave images for each displacement projection and spatially filtered complex wave
images. Calculated region of interest average values of storage modulus and the loss modulus for
brain tissues.

+ "Design of The Electrostatically Actuated MEMS Switch for RF Applications” May 2017 Studied a
MEMS switch with six strip membranes to understand its working principles. Modified the MEMS
switch to achieve a shorter actuation voltage range. Performed static and vibration analysis on the

D model of the switch using SolidWorks and ANSYS WorkBench.

+ “analysis of Automobile Steering System” Dec 2016 Applied the knowledge to understand the
working principle of an automobile steering system. Performed a static structural and dynamic

nalysis on the automobile steering system using ANSYS Workbench.

+ "Design of Thermoacoustic Engine” May 2015 Developed a thermoacoustic engine, which comprised
of different parts- regenerator, heat-pump, and heat-exchangers. Designed a 3D CAD model of the
engine in CATIA and performed for system analysis.
