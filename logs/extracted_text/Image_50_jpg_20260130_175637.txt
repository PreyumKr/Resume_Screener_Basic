Research Interests

| am currently interested in developing predictive models for mobility data (e.g., spatiotemporal or activity patterns
of humans in a spatial area during a certain time period), where | propose models to learn and predict a mobile
agent's sequential actions over time and under uncertainty using data mining and machine learning methods. | am
also interested in visualizing large and complex mobility data.
