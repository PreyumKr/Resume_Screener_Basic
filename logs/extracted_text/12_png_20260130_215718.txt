ACCOMPLISHMENTS

 

Carrying continuous improvement tools to Dorman Products, I was able to rebuild the supply chain of the packaging product group, with the
help of the product team to increase inventory turns, decrease company costs on packaging, and build strong relationships with product group
vendors. This one year project has lead to increased job performance, reduction in time spent on particular jobs, and has brought Dorman
more than $350,000 in yearly savings.
