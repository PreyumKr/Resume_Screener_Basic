PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY

Creative, unconventional, and introspective individual driven with the lifelong goal of trying to answer the questions: “What/who are we
humans,” and “What is life?” Soft skills acquired from introspection and the practice of empathy include tenacity, mental toughness, detail
orientation, and social skills. Hard skills acquired through academia (mainly) include a theoretical understanding and to an extent, practical
understanding, of foundational laboratory methods and a well-established understanding of a broad scope of topics under the interdisciplinary

field of neuroscience, including, but not limited to, neuroanatomy, language, sleep, audition, memory and learning, electrophysiology, neural

 

stem cells, neurological diseases, neurodevelopment, and neuronal cell biology. Quarters of academic and both wet lab and dry lab
involvement have cultivated a more well-rounded individual of science, and nourished a passion and urge for scientific exploration.
