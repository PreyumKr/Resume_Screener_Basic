Accomplishments

* Design and Implementation of DUA- RSA Algorithm for More Enhanced Public Key Encryption.” DUAL RSA - Dual RSA is
similar to RSA the major difference can be seen in the process of decryption where we use a unique private key, which cannot be
hacked by cryptanalyst.

* This design helps in the implementation of dual RSA algorithm for more enhanced public key encryption, using the principle or
cryptographic algorithm which includes symmetric and asymmetric keys

* Advantages of this project are Dual RSA performs encryption and decryption two blocks at a time and improves the
performance of RSA in terms of security.

* Volunteer at International Cultural Experience (ICE FDU) - XXX<4.

* Built a robot using microcontrollers and programming under the guidance of SKI Technologies.
