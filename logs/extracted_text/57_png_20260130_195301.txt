PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY

Thave been in Sales most of my life. I started working at age 12 with my dad, I went to businesses selling "Check Rite” the first check
guarantee machine. Then moved to collection and closing sales as a teenager. At 21 I started church work. I spent 10 years running a full
ministry team, paid and volunteer staff, over 300 children in attendance. Going back into sales, after taking time off for my kids, I began selling
for Salad Master in Atlanta Georgia. My sales rate was quite high, I went from 10% to 30% commission within a few months. Then took the
business to unclaimed territory in Reno Nevada. As a mother of seven, Ihave had many years away from the job force. Iam a single mom,

ready to start working again. Like my Daddy always said "You could sell sand in the desert!" So, to sales I shall go again!
