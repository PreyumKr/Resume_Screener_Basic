Project Experience:

Chemical Safety Cart (Senior Project at MTU):

Designed and built a cart to move chemicals across campus safely and effectively in a team of three. We used Creo to
design the cart, and the Schoo! of Technology's Machine shop to build the cart.
Advanced Metalworks Enterprise: CN Rail Team

Decreased the time it takes to test railroad for cracks from 20 minutes to less than a minute by using Magnetic Particle
Inspection instead of using a penetrant paint in a small team.

Class Room Experience:

Gained a real world understanding of how many processes it takes to make U-P key chains in my Manufacturing
Process class. The steps the metal went through included: extrusion from stock, cut to shape, sanded, anodized, and
painJessica.

Leamed effective team building through working with students to create Metal Poster Frames in my Quality Techiques
class.

Developed an understanding of Lean Principles and practices in my Lean Manufacturing and Process Planning class.

Increased my experience with physical 3D modeling in m Contemporary Sculpture, Advanced Sculpture class, and
Machine Tool Fundamental class
