‘+ Autumn 2019 Study Abroad in Amsterdam, The Netherlands: From Sea to Shining Sea
Itwas a 4-week program where we studied and compared the policies toward sustainability and
environmental issues of the ports of Seattle/Tacoma WA and the ports of RotterdamvAmsterdam.
The first couple weeks before going to The Netherlands we were able to visit the Port of Tacoma, where
we learn the policies and environmental practices here in the US.
Once we were in Europe we visited the Port of Amsterdam and were So lucky to have a couple of
different conferences at the port of Rotterdam. Sustainability was the top priority, this will lead to help
the environment, save large amounts of money and make them more profitable. Some of their future
goals include having the whole Port run itself and to create and share a digital planning tool where you
can track the cargo while the system calculates the most sustainable, faster, and cheapest route.
The biggest difference between Tacoma and Rotterdam was significant in their delivery styles and
methods. Tacoma still very behind in sustainability whereas Rotterdam is so far advanced in the sense
that they already have size, bigger containers, better routes, and it is economically driven, they want to
spread they are learning to other ports to make it more efficient system as a whole on a global level
