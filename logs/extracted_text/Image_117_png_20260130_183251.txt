As an Inside Sales Representative at Datameer, it is my goal to enable enterprises so they can get value out of
their big data and make insights-driven decisions.

2+ years of experience in enterprise B2B sales, sales development, and partnerships. I've also had the

opportunity to test and implement innovative sales strategies in order to create synergies with named accounts
and build relationships with key decision makers and influencers.
