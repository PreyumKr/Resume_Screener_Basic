Continuous Improvement Coordinator (Contract), 01/2017 to 08/2017
Hershey Entertainment & Resorts Company — Hershey, PA
My task, and one of the key purposes for bringing me into Northern Star Company, was to work alongside the Continuous
Improvement team to implement a fully functional Document Control System (DCS). By meeting with subject matter experts
(Machine Operators, Mechanics, Supervisors, Engineers, etc.) and utilizing operation manuals, I was then able to produce the most
correct and effective instructions that we then used to train and coach current employees and new hires. Being the sole author, editor,
publisher, and overseer of the DCS, this task came with much adversity and many revisions. Determined to create a user-friendly
system and in collaboration with colleagues and clients, I designed and produced Standard Operating Procedures for 90% of the
value streams in the manufacturing plant. This effort contributed largely to the improvement in production outputs, decreases in
wasted product, and decreases in time required to fully on-board new operators.
