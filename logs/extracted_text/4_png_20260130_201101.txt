Executive Summary

‘An accomplished and collaborative cancer biologist with experience in developing and optimizing biomarker assays within
preclinical and clinical programs, as well as evaluating the performance of a novel diagnostic platform. Designed and executed
ctitical experiments assessing validity of biomarkers using clinical biospecimens derived from oncology patients. Deep knowledge of
cancer biology and tumor development/progression through use of genetically-engineered mouse models of glioma and colon cancer
as well as different cell culture techniques and in vitro assays. Established record of pushing research programs forward through
creative experimentation. Stellar communication abilities evidenced by publication record in peer-reviewed journals, numerous
successful grant applications, poster competition awards, and presentations across different scientific and executive management

groups.
