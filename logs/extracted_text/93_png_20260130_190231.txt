PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY

‘My first job and current job is being a cashier. | first started started out at Target when I was 16 years
old and from there have worked there ever since. | have learned a lot from this job from
‘communication skills and learning how to connect with people in a short amount of time. | also learned
how to work a cash reigster and handle money. This job has alo helped me with my communication
skills and being more open as a person. Then in the summer of 2019 is when I decided | needed
something new job wise so I worked for the HOTV YMCA as an assistant child care teacher. | worked
with children at Tanner Elementary school and played with children ages 4-12 years old. | went on field
trips with the children and also went swimming with them at the YMCA on swimming and gymnastics
day. | helped prepare morning and afternoon snack and alsp helped apply sunscreen to the little's when
we were to go outdoors. When fall of 2020 came around | moved to Green bay for college and began
working at KinderCare as an assistant child care teacher for the toddler B classroom. Here, I work with
toddlers and help them with emotional, physical, and social devlopment through play, activities, and
by learning outdoors. We do lots of fun activities each month based on out theme for the month.
Overall I love working with children and plan on working with children when I obtain a full time career
after graduating college.
