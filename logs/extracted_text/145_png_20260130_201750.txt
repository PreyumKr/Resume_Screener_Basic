EpucaTion

Bachelor of Science: Electrical Engineering And Creative Writing , 05/1999

Massachusetts Institute of Technology - Cambridge. MA.

These are joint engineering and writing degrees; I did a thesis which combined both degrees in order to gain an understanding of how human
factors and labor issues shape the computer chip fabrication industry. I completed the coursework for both the engineering and writing degrees,
focusing on acoustics within electrical engineering and on bilingual writing within the creative writing department.

Bachelor of Science: Women's Studies , 05/1999

Massachusetts Institute of Technology - Cambridge. MA.

This degree was undertaken to further my understanding of the social issues related to engineering, and focused on the social construction of
gender. This degree placed special emphasis on the roles that race and class play in the expression of gender. Through film-making, I explored
the ways that women of different racial and social backgrounds define beauty.

‘Master of Science: Library And Information Science , 12/2011
Simmons College - Boston, MA
This degree focused on the history of distance education in Mexico and on the information policies that countries around the world have

adopted concerning their national collections.
