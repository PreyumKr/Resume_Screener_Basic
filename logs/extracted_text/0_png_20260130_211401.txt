EXPERIENCE

Year Up - Information Technology
Lincoln, RI + 01/2011 - Current

Iwas hired to manage accreditation efforts for a major department modernization project involving 3
accreditation packages each leading to successful Authorization To Operate decisions. Responsibilities
then increased to include all departmental accreditation efforts leading to another 3 successful ATOs.
Now, working on 4 new accreditation including re-authorization for an existing project. Succeeded in
writing and implementing vulnerability management for existing accredited systems. Success of the
accreditation hinged on coordination with ONI Enterprise in critical design decisions and to help the
program integrate smoothly into the Enterprise thru many meetings, analyzing the Enterprise business
model to understand the best fit for the program. The different projects required careful management
of specific STIG compliance and hardening for the different configurations and services required for
the specific domain to be integrated. Analyzed complex computer systems to assess vulnerability and
risk, Supervised 5 external computer consultants and vendors. Managed application patches, data
backup, security changes and network configuration,

was Hired to initiate processing strategies in fulfilling department analyst requirements.
Requirements were fulfilled thru identifying product problems and strengths and collected data on
customer experience and review of Enterprise compliance to transition to new technology for
supporting new processing needs thru proper processing power. The next challenge came as storage
requirements for better performance and more controlled uses. After careful study of local
infrastructure design, a local storage with off the shelf solutions was adopted to grow local storage to
‘over 20078. In using this solution, the department saved just over a million dollars in purchasing and
maintenance costs compared to the alternative. Next came requirements to improve processing of
future big data formats fulfilled in a Red Hat Linux high compute cluster | designed, purchased and
accredited for operation in the Enterprise. Improvement on big data analytical processing reduced
time from 30 hours to 30 minutes as well as allow for more robust data thru higher selections of
sensors, frequencies and range than allowed thru the traditional process.
