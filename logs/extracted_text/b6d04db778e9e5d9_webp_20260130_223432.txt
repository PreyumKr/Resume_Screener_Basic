PROJECTS

 

City Department of Transportation Road Network Capacity Research | November 2021 - Present

- Proposed using and implemented macroscopic fundamental diagrams to analyze traffic capacity in City.

+ Simulated the complete traffic of an 8km2 area in the City with PTV Visum/Vissim using limited loop detector data with 95% and 86% of the
roads achieving under 5.0 GEH and 10 relative standard deviations, respectively.

+ Partitioned City's network with a community detection algorithm using Python to reduce flow variance.

- Constructed the macroscopic fundamental diagrams for each road network partition using Python, confirming that the City's traffic was at
about 70% of the capacity.

Airport Subway Planning | May 2021 - August 2021

+ Proposed and planned a 16-stop airport subway that combines with an existing train route in City.

- Computed the optimal stops and frequency for 3 train types using linear programming based on the OD matrix.
+ Designed a double-track layout with appropriate sidings to minimize delays and optimize the train schedule.

- Calculated a train schedule using a signaling block system that avoided clashes with the combined train route.

High Tech Facility Construction Planning | January 2021 - May 2021

+ Devised a 267-day construction plan for a 4-story semiconductor fabrication plant using MS Project with CPM.
+ Proposed optimal construction site paths and site subdivisions for each of the 15 major planned stages.

+ Reduced the maximum labor per day from 255 to 180 person-days using the resource smoothing technique.
