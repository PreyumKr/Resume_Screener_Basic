Additional Information

With over 35 years in the food and beverage industry, I have retired as the Culinary Asts Instructor at the Fort Osage Career and
Technology Center, a 2-year program for grades 11/12. Food literacy is the vehicle I have used to motivate kids to take an active
interest in their own lives and to connect to their communities.

“My mission has been to teach students to become positive contributors and leaders through an integrated approach of teaching
Technical, Academic and 21st Century skills facilitated by active, voluntary learning. With a focus on college and career readiness,
the “farm-to-fork” curriculum introduced growing, cooking, serving, and eating food as they relate to professional and personal
success and well-being.

The food service industry has given me immeasurable opportunities and experiences I would not have otherwise had. I’m convinced
of that, It has the capacity to educate, connect families, and unite friends as few things can. I am eager to apply my talents, skills, and

innovative approach to help solve today’s most pressing social issues.
