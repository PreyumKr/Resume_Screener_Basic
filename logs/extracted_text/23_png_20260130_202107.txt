Experience

Designer, 01/2016 to Current

Apple Inc. - Las Vegas, NV

Started as a back-up designer for floral arrangements and gift baskets and had no experience. However, with very little training I was
able to make quality arrangements without help or supervision. Less than 6 months later, I was able to be trusted to run the shop 2-3

days a week without a manager and took care of daily operations with pride.

Student Assistant, 07/2014 to Current
The New School — New York, NY
Cared for children ages bisth-4 years old. Was able to remain calm in many stressful situations and help the children learn and grow

into amazing young people. Easily trained on tasks and procedures and was quickly made a reliable and trustworthy team member.

Team Member, 07/2012 to 01/2016

Vinaigrette Salad Kitchen — Louisville, KY

I started by making drinks and worked my way up to a position of leadership where I trained new employees on everything from
making drinks, cooking and assembling food, taking orders, working the cash register, cleaning dishes, preparing food, and closing
and opening the store. I received three raises while I was there and was known as a very hardworking and quick learning team

member.
