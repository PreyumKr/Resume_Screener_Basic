Work Experience
Mechanical Design Engineer 2010-05 - Present
NASA

«Preparing the bill of materials,

‘* Traveling to the project site when necessary to take physical
measurements required to complete requested designs.

‘* Overseeing mechanical design phases from concept through the
production.

‘* Weighing cost constraints while preparing project design
schedules,

* Collaborating with a senior mechanical engineer on large scale
projects

* Confirming compliance with design standards.

Design and Development Engineer 2007-03 - 2010-04
Google

‘* Managed all phases of the design process for a multitude of
products, components, parts, assemblies, and subassemblies,
including drafting, dimensioning, tolerancing, prototyping and
documenting results,

‘* Commended for strengths in defining, assessing and satisfying
complex product functional specifications and
manufacturability concerns.

‘* Designed innovative component/module replacements for
existing machinery that improved functioning and extended the
life of equipment thought to be obsolete for a fraction of the total
replacement cost

‘* Developed new assemblies that accelerated the client
production line speed by up to 25%.

‘Became the go-to expert on evaluating design models for ISO,
and form-fit-function compliance.

‘* Saved money in costly rework through careful design review
that identified flaws in new subassembly and parts models prior
to production.

Junior Design Engineer 2003-03 - 2007-02
GE Aviation

‘* Learned design and uses of Life Safety Net 2000, Edwards
Signature series & Wheelock Fire protection devices

‘* Created submittal packages of riser drawings, wiring details,
panel drawings, as-built (Data Gathering Panel, Strobe panel,
modules, etc.) with the use of Contract Sales Administrator
software.
