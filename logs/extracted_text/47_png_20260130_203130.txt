AWS ECR and write logs to CloudWatch Logs.

+ Deployed Configuration management and provisioning to AWS using Packer-Docker and Terraform,
involved in auto-mated deployment of EBS on to the AWS EC2 instance server and automated the
complete deployment environment on AWS

+ Created an Azure DevOps Continuous Integration, Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Pipelines. Wrote
k8s.Yml files for deployment, ingress and service for Cl Pipeline and Kubernetes Cluster creation
deployment files for Cl pipeline.

+ Deployed containers on AWS ECS. Created ECS Clusters using a Serverless resource, Fargate,
complying with PaaS logic. Added IAM Roles in Task Definition, allowing Fargate to pull images from
AWS ECR and write logs to CloudWatch Logs.

+ Worked with diverse Amazon AWS tools and assisted in building infrastructure for various web
applications using a serverless applications: Elastic Beanstalk, API Gateway, DynamobB etc.

+ Built and deployed Docker containers hosted on Kubernetes to break up monolithic app into
microservices resulting in improved developer workflow and an increase in speed and scalability.
Used the Jenkins automation server to deploy AWS CodeBuild artifacts with AWS CodeDeploy,
created a functioning CI/CD pipeline

+ After implementation, CI/CD pipetine is triggered by code changes made on GitHub repo,
automatically fed into CodeBuild, after which output is deployed on CodeDeploy.

run on an AWS Fargate + AWS EC2 configured cluster.

+ Set up CI/CD pipelines for Microservices and integrated tools such as Maven, Bitbucket,
SonarQube, Nexus, Docker, slack for providing immediate feedback to DEV teams after code check-
in,

+ Migrated components of a monolithic application into the AWS cloud over AWS Direct Connect
using over a private virtual interface. Configured cloud VPN Gateway to enable migration of data
into the cloud, while using a complementary Customer Gateway to enable connection with the On-
Prem.

least privilege. Integrated S3 bucket with a web domain

+ Used CloudFront distribution to serve bucket content globally using AWS Edge locations. Configured
AWS Certificate Manager SSL for encryption in transi

+ Migrated data from On-Prem locations to multiple AWS VPCs in the cloud. Configured AWS Direct
Connect to migrate data over private network and then launched an AWS Transit Gateway in the
cloud to connect multiple VPCs. Linked Transit Gateway with a Direct Connect Gateway and then to
Direct Connect to enable secure, seamless hybrid connections of multiple VPCs with the on-prem.

+ Managed VPC and subnets for a three-tier application, initiated connections between different
Availability Zones, blocked suspicious IP ranges in subnets via NACL.

+ Configured CloudTrail to track user activities on EC2 based server applications Logged CloudTrail
trail in .CloudWatch logs for further analysis.

+ Built a multiplayer, turn-based gaming application using Dynamo DB tables and items, AWS SNS,
AWS Cognito, AWS Lambda and AWS Cloud9.
