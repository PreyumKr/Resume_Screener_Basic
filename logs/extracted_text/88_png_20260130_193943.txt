PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY

Tam a motivated individual who wants to succeed in life. To me an education is very important and is something that I always wanted to pursue
in my life. This was one of my biggest reasons for joining the Navy. As soon as the Navy authorized my education benefits I started taking
classes. After earning my Bachelors degree I thought I was satisfied. Then I found out that I could get an MBA with a concentration in cyber
security from UT Tyler, and then I knew I had a new educational goal to pursue.
