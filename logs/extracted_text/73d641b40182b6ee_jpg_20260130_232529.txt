SOFTWARE TESTER

 

SUMMARY

I've been searching for the ideal field of work that suits my passions and skills. | usually
question everything and see different paths and possibilities for any encountered
systems, and based on these attributes | know that the best field for me is IT,
specifically Quality Assurance.

The breakthrough came when | decided to help a programmer friend who is developing
iOS applications. Working together with him and running different test scenarios, | found
‘out more about what a QA actually does. | eventually took on the role of a software
tester, familiarizing myself with manual testing techniques.

The experience | have gained so far has taught me the basic principles of software
testing. To further my knowledge, | have studied for the ISTQB Foundation Level and got
my certificate. Curiosity has started to turn into passion quickly once | discovered the
interesting challenges that a software tester has to tackle every day.
