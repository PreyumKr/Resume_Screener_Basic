Rapid Global Business Solutions, Inc
Customer acceptance is crucial for the fight against white-collar crime. It is the first hurdle to overcome enabling
criminals to misuse the services of financial institutions for criminal intents. In order to fight money laundering, the
financing of terrorism, and other criminal acts, international minimum standards have been enacted for the identification
of new customers. The Know Your Customer principle obliges banks and insurance companies to identify applicants,
before they can be accepted as customers. Motivation and plausibility of the business relation have to be checked and an
initial risk classification for each new customer has to be issued,
Siron KYC is a tool that enables banks to create customer data in dynamic and customizable acceptance questionnaires
and to match it with PEP, embargo and other lists in real-time. As soon as the research systems detect a considerable
deviation from the actual customer behavior an alert is reported to the Compliance Officer.
