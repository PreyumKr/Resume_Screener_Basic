• Project #1: Integrate AWP from Alternate Source The Integrate AWP from Alternate Source project was redesigned to replace the AWP (Average Wholesale Price) received from First Databank to an alternate source, because of the discontinuation of the AWP price update from the FDB.

• The technical goal of this project is to receive a feed from Mainframe CX that contains the new AWP from the alternate source which is a Medi-Span.
• This new feed which, now, has the source of AWP along with the AWP pricing data is then loaded into the production tables using the existing business logic so as to keep the process as transparent as possible.
• The major segments that underwent changes and were tested during this project are as follows.
• Weekly DrugPricing Refresh.
• Daily Drug Pricing Update.
• Audit Reports.
