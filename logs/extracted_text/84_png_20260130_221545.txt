ACCOMPLISHMENTS

 

* Developed mobile satellite communication systems with COTS (commercial off-the-shelf) components. This none custom equipment and
parts purchase resulted in a large saving of $1.2M.

Expanded C30 ACU (Antenna Controller) into a universal controller for operations of multi antenna systems which nearly doubled sales in
one year.

Adaptive change in system outdated video driver boards; resistor value change allowed repairs to be made with current day available
component thus eliminating the need to purchase an upgrade with cost saving of $250,000
