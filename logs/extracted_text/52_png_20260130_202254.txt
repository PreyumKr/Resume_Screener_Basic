SUMMARY

Hello, my Name is Jessica Claire and I'm an entry-level Graphic Designer, Social Media Content Creator, and Photographer. I plan to extend my
experiences to the end, reaching the goal to create Digital Media content for big social media influencers and companies. In my off time, I use
my time to learn new trends of the year when it comes to marketing and design. I also take this time to practice within Adobe Suite programs to
build upon my portfolio. Currently, I am at Lord Fairfax Community College to obtain an Associate's in Liberal Arts to transfer to a BFA in
Graphic Design and Animation. Iam excited about the future and how I can use my future experiences to build my portfolio.
