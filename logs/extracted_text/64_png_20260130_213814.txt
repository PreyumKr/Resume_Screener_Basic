Education

Master of Science: Advanced Data Analytics
University of North Texas - Denton, TX
* This course work provided me an overview of quantitative methods essential for analyzing data, with an emphasis on business
and industry applications. Gained hands-on experience on various tools and technologies such as BigQuery with GCP,
statistical tools such as SAS, visualization tools such as Google Data Studio and Tableau, Deep Learning using Python with
libraries like Numpy, Pandas, TensorFlow,Matplotlib, Keras, etc.

Master of Technology: Machine Learning And Computing, 05/2020
KL University - Vijayawada, IN
* This course work provided me detailed knowledge on machine learning and deep learning concepts with real-time
applications. Gained hands-on working experience with Machine Learning algorithms such as Classification and Prediction
algorithms like Linear Regression, SVM, KNN, Naive Bayes, etc. and, Python libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib etc.
Awarded with a Presidential Gold Medal for academic excellence.

Bachelor of Technology: Computer Science And Engineering, 05/2016
JNTU - Hyderabad, IN

* Bachelors in Computer Science with 72.25%.
Publications

Published a paper entitled “Mobile SMS Spam Filter Techniques using Machine Learning Techniques” In International Journal Of
Scientific Technology and Research.
« The base point of this research work is, differentiating the messages which are legitimate or not.
* To compare between these messages, Ihave used various machine learning algorithms to predict the messages and calculate the
accuracy criterion by using the SMS Spam dataset.
* Thave used word tokenization for segmenting the message in keeping with phrases, characters or symbols. Also, used
vectorization to convert the text into appropriate numerical values.
* Used Python, PyCharm IDE , Python libraries such as TensorFlow, Pandas, etc.
