‘Two95 International Inc. - Sr ETL Developer
08/2014 - 02/2016

Client : CVS Caremark, Rhode Island, USA

Project Details
Business wanted to develop a secondary data-center in active-active architecture to support its drug
dispensing application. The main purpose of which is to share load /traffic on the regular basis and
quick recovery from other site in a case of disaster to support all the 7700 stores without any
downtime for the application.

Roles and Responsibilities

+ Coordinated with business analyst and solution architect for the requirement analysis and
identification of key design component in BRD.

+ Converted business requirement into high level and low level designs and drafted the same in SDD.

+ Drove research for proof-of-concept for key design decision in active-active architecture.

+ Designed and customized data models using ERwin for supporting application in a 2 site scenario.

+ Created/refactored ETL flows using Informatica PowerCenter9.x to extract data from flat files,
relational tables (Oracle10g\11g) and XML files to transform\load the data accordingly. Also,
developed updated PL/SQL procedures /packages and called them through ETL flow.

+ Tuned the existing ETL flow for better performance.

+ Designed and implemented process automation using Unix shell scripting for handling restartablity
of batch jobs from other site.

+ Created Unix shell scripts & PMCMD commands to start workflows from unix shell, to FTP files from
remote server, file watcher mechanism and backup of repository and folder.

+ Refactored existing shell scripts to handle active-active architecture.

+ Created scheduling jobs in Control-M to schedule the sessions.

+ Created and executed unit test cases, Coordinated with QA team for defect resolution and
dlosure.

+ Provided recommendations\inputs for migration strategy for ETL/batch processes.
