EXPERIENCE

Department Of Agriculture - Biological Science TechnicJessica
Gainesville, FL + 04/2017 - Current

+ Install long-term forest vegetation plots and collect vegetation data (e.g. vegetation structure,
species inventory, plant vigor, DBH, tree cores etc.), soil samples, and other environmental data
(e.g. unvegetated surface substrate, slope, aspect, topographical position etc.)

+ Inventory and monitor endangered and rare plant species (e.g. Platanthera spp., Spiranthes spp.)
‘as well as other species threatened by illegal harvesting (e.g. Panax quinquefolius)

+ Conduct wetland surveys throughout the park by utilizing an iPad outfitted with ArcGIS Collector
and an external GPS to delineate wetland boundaries and collect other data (e.g. species inventory,
National Vegetation Classification System classification, Cowardin classification, Hydrogeomorphic
dlassification)

+ Served from 2017-2019 as the principal technicJessica conducting field accuracy assessments of
the park’s GIS-based vegetation maps hiking over 1500 miles and personally completing 734 of the
973 plots for the project generating over 15,000 plant species records and 5,000 plot photos

+ Utilize tools and technologies to collect and record data such as hypsometers, densiometers,
diameter tapes, meter tapes, clinometers, sighting compasses, increment borers, calipers, digital
cameras, iPad tablets, external GPS devices for iPads, Trimble Units, and GPS devices

+ Work with park ecologists and data managers to manage and update tabular and geospatial
databases for the park and regularly utilize software applications such as MS Access, MS Excel,
ArcGIS Online, ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS Collector, Survey 123, and DNR GPS to collect, store, retrieve,
analyze, and report data

+ Assist park ecologists with the supervision of field interns (e.g. training, mentoring, and
evaluations)

+ Lead workshops for park staff and volunteers on forest ecology related subjects and assist park
interpretive staff with the development of educational programs and materials,

 

University Of Colorado Boulder - Research Assistant
Boulder, CO + 07/2015 - 04/2017

+ Conducted long-term monitoring of wild populations of American ginseng for a project aiming to
determine the extent to which environmental and genetic factors influence the production of
secondary plant compounds in American ginseng

+ Utilized GPS devices to navigate to plots and collected biological (e.g. morphological, genetic,
phytochemical) and environmental data (e.g. soil, light levels, moisture levels)

+ Identified new populations of American ginseng and utilized a Trimble Tool and laser range finder
to map out the locations of each plant within the population.

+ Performed phytochemical extractions of collected plant tissue samples using Wiley mill and
methanol reflux condenser

+ First author of a paper entitled, “Partial-root Harvest of American Ginseng (Panax quinquefolius

Non-Destructive Method for Harvesting Root Tissue for Ginsenoside Analysis” which was
published in Issue 84-2 of “Castanea; The Journal of the Southern AppalachJessica Botanical
Society” on December 13, 2019

+ Presented on research findings at the Association of Southeastern Biologists Conference in
‘Montgomery, Alabama on March 30, 2017, the Future of Ginseng and Forest Botanicals Symposium
in Morgantown, WV on July 13, 2017, and at the UNCA Undergraduate Research Symposium in
Asheville, NC on April 23, 2019

 

Department Of Agriculture - Biological Science TechnicJessica
Gold Beach, OR » 05/2014 - 09/2014

+ Conducted quadrat-based vegetation surveys in Pisgah and Nantahala National Forests using a
random-stratified sampling of predicted habitat distribution models in order to assess the
distribution of wild American ginseng populations in these forests

+ Followed standardized protocols to collect and record biological (e.g. morphological, genetic,
associated species) and environmental data (e.g. micro-topography, canopy cover, etc.) using an
iPad tablet

+ Operated 4WD vehicle on US Forest Service roads and used GPS, a compass, and various maps to
plan routes and competently navigate physically demanding terrain with a heavy backpack while
sometimes spending several nights at a time in the field
