Professional Summary

Thave a huge passion for Life and what I do. I attain that by believing in what I do, what I sell and even more for the company I
represent.

When [heard about this position at Molson Coors through a 27 year veteran employee and read the overview of the responsibilities,
skills and the Molson Coors “EPICQ’s”, I stopped right there and it took 30 seconds for me to process that and know that this was an
ideal fit for me. Everything that I want in a company, its beliefs, values, ethics, passion, integrity you have and everything that you

want in an employee I possess.

I believe that I’m in possession of a very unique set of skills that can help take the Molson Coors team to a premier level. I have faith
that if given an opportunity I will embrace it, hold nothing back, share the passion that Ihave, and take whatever challenges
presented and make Molson Coors better than it is today on the way to being the best that it has ever been.

Iwill help enhance the Molson Coors experience and give employees and customers excitement about being a part of our company. I
want to learn and experience more about Molson Coors and the benefits of being a part of your team. I want to make each customer I
talk with happy and satisfied, and do the same with each employee as a team member. My formula for being a successful company is
simple: “a happy employee makes a happy customer which then equals a very happy company!”

Iam always confident and proud of what I do. I enjoy people, whether working with them or assisting them. I would love an
opportunity to show you what I really can do if given the chance. Ihave many skills, gifts and talents at leading, assisting, directing,
selling, encouraging, guiding and coaching. I have worked many college basketball athletic events. In my volunteer work Iam used
to working with high profile college coaches and athletes on a big stage. In my past work experience with United Airlines, I worked
many customer booths selling merchandise and all of the UAL products and services. I have excellent customer service skills and I
love resolving any issue that a customer might be having, sometimes that is where the biggest reward can come from: when the

customer is made happy.

Iam excited about the future and I believe that Ihave a lot to offer a very special company, I want that company to be Molson Coors.
