Teaching has always been, and will always be, my career dream. Ever since the age of six, | knew it was what |
was born with a passion to do. | am a highly motivated and enthusiastic, student-centered teacher focused on
helping every student reach for and achieve their potential. | have many experiences coordinating effective
lesson plans and collaborating with colleagues and administrators. My classroom management strategies are
practical and time relevant to the needs of our current students. The instructional tools | design and
implement are intended to meet the needs of each individual within the larger group classroom. Identitying
each student's zone of proximal development is a focus of my teaching. This idea surrounding lesson
planning and implementation allows me to assist students in meeting them where they are at, and helping
them to create and accomplish both academic and personal goals.
