‘+ Applied oss functions and variance explanation techniques to compare performance metrics.

+ Did a project on Movielens Dataset Analysis with details as follows: The Group Lens Research Project
is a research group in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering in the University of
Minnesota. The researchers of this group are involved in many research projects related to the fields of
information fitering, collaborative fitering, and recommender systems. So, | performed the analysis,
using the Exploratory Data Analysis technique. Applied the tools of machine learning to predict the
survivors of the tragedy.

‘+ Presented findings orally and in writing with advanced mathematical models.

+ Ran statistical analyses within software to process large datasets

TUDENT 06/2015 to 08/2020
Walden University | City, STATE
‘+ I did my dissertation for the fulfilment of PhD study on topic of construction project management
maturity model determination and correlation to success factor.
+ The research grounded on theories of leadership, management, organizational behavior, and project
management.
‘+ Quantitative data were collected from 190 professional managers in from government, consultant, and
contractors.
+ More than 90 variables, and 20,000 data entry were used in research.
+ Remote data collection tools and methods effectively used to complete the study.
+ I'successfully designed, apply the methods to find solutions for the most project management failures
as related to the key project management knowledge driving project succeed or failed
‘+ I defended well and the study is released online since September as open source by the time of this
application 580 copies were downloaded.
‘+ After school, | am here to apply the fresh energy in fields of one of the critical resource.
