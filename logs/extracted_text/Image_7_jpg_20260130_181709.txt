Introduction :

The main reason we chose this project is to help the buyers in Dubai, to make
purchase items easier sitting in their homes or offices rather than having to go
down to the market to buy it, site makes this all the more profitable and a good
addition to a shopper's tool kit. Our online shopping website concentrate mainly
on electronics. It will allow customers to look at the items on sale, search for
specific items through item specification or through name. The customer will be
able to log in to the website to make use of the ‘add to cart’ feature and select
items to be checked out at a later time. The details of the purchase and delivery
information are delivered to the customer through email that the customer
provides. The customer needs to make the cash payment only when the product
is delivered at his/her place. The further processing of the delivery of goods is
done through the phone number which the customer provides at the time of
his/her sign up to the Shopping Website.
