PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

Faacon, tne ~Toledo, Ohio
‘Mechanical Design Engineer, 3/2011 ~ Present

Collaborate with product developers and engineers to develop and operotionolice state-of-the-art alternative
power plant concepts for automativeapplications.

Research and review existing technologies based upon target markets; apply dasign analysis, FEA process, and
non-linear engineering concept to create plans, Coordinate with suppliers / vendors and intemal engineering
resoutees to obtain prototype parts and equipment; define functional, dimensional, and visual requirements
for components. Evaluate and demonstrate manufacturing feasibility and technical justification for design
‘approach; conduct design validation. Maintain comprehensive documentation of complex desig activites

+ Doubled life of liquid hydrogen in vehicle-mounted tanks in callaboration wth Chemical
Engineers during design of hydrogen re-uptake and sublimation reclamation system,

* Conceived, designed, nd prototyped light-weight infritely variable transmission (WT) for
use with hydrogen fuel cell engines, resulting in 63% improvement in fuel efficiency

+ Played integral role in patent-pending electric motorcycle concept combining miniaturized NT
with cegenerative braking

+ Developed low-weight, low-friction piston assembly for ai pressure vehicle (aircar), increasing

top speed of prototype by 12% with no decrease in range.
