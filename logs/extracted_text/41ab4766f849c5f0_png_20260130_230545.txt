MY ROAD TO GENERAL MANAGER

My initial plan was to graduate from the NY Medical College and pursue a career as a
personal trainer. Working out has been my biggest passion since my teenage years and |
figured that this is a great way to stay fit, help others and earn a stable income. As the
years passed, | got more interested in the business side of gyms and decided to try and
get myself a position in management.
