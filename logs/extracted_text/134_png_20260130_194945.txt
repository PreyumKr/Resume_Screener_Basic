My Ph.D. career focused on developing technologies and materials to advance the fields of sulfur based
infrared optical polymers, optical telecommunications, and lithium-sulfur batteries. This work was highly
collaborative as highlighted by the numerous publications produced as an effort between different groups/
colleges at the University of Arizona, as well as other institutions. Given the nature of this multi-disciplinary
work, | have I have a strong background not only in organic/polymer synthesis and characterization, but also
ina variety of device fabrication techniques.

+ Device Fabrication: + Small molecule synthesis/characterization
* Coin cell fabrication/testing + Polymer synthesis and characterization (RAFT,
‘+ Melt/solution polymer processing ATRP, Lactide ROP. ROMP)
+ Fabrication of bulk and microoptic elements + Instrumentation Experience
+ Glove box use + Spectroscopy (UV-Vis, ATR/FTIR, NMR)
+ Clean room and photolithography experience + _‘Size Exclusion Chromatography
+ Laboratory Synthesis: + Differential Scanning Calorimetry
+ Synthetic desing/planning + Thermogravimetric Analysis
CONSULTANT 06/2020 to CURRENT

L&T Infotech | Dallas, TX

+ Worked as a consultant to support an NSF SBIR grant aimed at bringing to market the minimum viable
product using sulfur based materials as part of the optical component for IR imaging

PFCNCIPLE RESEARCH SPECIALIST 11/2019 to CURRENT
The New School | New York, NY
+ Designed new materials enabling novel methods for connecting photonic integrated circuits to meet
industrial requirements/metrics of reducing the cost of optical alignment and enabling greater modularity
in fabrication processes
‘+ Worked to synthesize and process biodegradable materials into stents to help reduce clotting and aide
in tissue regeneration following heart surgery.
‘+ Designed and synthesized new organic comonomer motifs for sulfur based IR optical materials to
chemically engineer new windows of transparency

GFOADUATE RESEARCH ASSISTANT 08/2014 to 12/2019
The University Of Arizona | City, STATE

‘+ Improved thermomechanical properties while retaining desired performance of sulfur based infrared
optical devices

+ Devised methods of increasing the refractive index of sulfur based materials by incorporating other
chalcogens into the polymer

+ Development of highly efficient, wholly solution processable dielectric mirrors utilizing high refractive
index sulfur based materials

‘+ Developed materials that undergo photolithographically defined changes in refractive index to facilitate
fabrication of polymer waveguides devoid of etching steps
