+ Capstone Project:
California Housing Price System (California), [Development and
| worked in the data science field. So we decided to go with Python and used to various modules available in
the market. We used various datasets to get the various features on which the pricingof the house depends
Also, by carefully examined the data we got an idea of what are the most valuable features are in deciding the
price of the house. Like geographic location, or crime rate or nearby facilities,
After the model is built and ready to be hosted on the local network we will add fiters in order to tweak the
model or filter out any unwanted results ]
