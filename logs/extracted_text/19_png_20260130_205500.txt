‘+ Think of ProsRent as the “Uber” of construction equipment from Porto's and dumpsters to aerial
equipment, all the way to Earth moving equipment there's a better way to rent construction equipment -
one that utilizes technology to bring renters and suppliers together to do business fairly.

Project Scope:

+ Primarily responsible to connect multiple source systems (Order Life Cycle, Billing Management &
Invoice Gen, Supplier and Inventory Management System, Notification Management System) in to data
warehouse with the effective Design, Development, Validation and Support activities to assure that it's
producing values to our Business

Responsibilities:

+ Worked with the business analysts and data analytics team to gather business requirements to be
translated into design considerations

‘+ Used Informatica Intelligent Cloud Service for (ETL) extraction, transformation and loading data from
heterogeneous source systems into target database

‘+ Prepared Various mappings to load the data into different stages like Landing, Staging, and Target
tables

‘+ Through IICS created mappings for Order Life Cycle Management System to get the data trom
PostgreSQL in GCP Cloud to On-Premises Oracle Datawarehouse.

+ Extracted data from Oracle, PostgreSQL and loaded them into Big Query/Google Cloud Storage

+ Created and maintained SCD-1 and 2 mappings to maintain history from source to target for accessing
the history of Order Life Cycle information

‘+ Extracted the data from Order Life Cycle Management System and transformed the data using IICS and
loaded it in to Oracle database for the Invoice Generator application to produce automated Invoice

+ Developed various mappings using Cloud Mapping Designer and worked with Aggregator, Lookup,
Filter, Router, Joiner, Source Qualifier, Expression, Sorter, and Sequence Generator transformations

+ Worked on Parameterization of all variables and connections at all levels.

+ Created reusable transformation objects such as mapplets, User defined functions to avoid duplication
of metadata and reducing the development time

‘+ Written SQL queries and applied at different levels like Source query, pre-SQL, post-SQL and
Optimized SQL scripts to improve performance

+ Experience in partitioning and pushdown optimization.
