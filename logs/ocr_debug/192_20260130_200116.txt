‘* Have taken full leadership of streamlining the Food Science lab by installing, operating, maintaining and creating SOPs for the
equipment and instruments in the lab.
* Draw methods from across literature to design and run experiments for protein isolation and purification from different sources,
and evaluate results using protein analytical assays,
* Troubleshoot and optimize methods to increase the yield and purity; collaborate with the Principal Process Engineer to evaluate
its viability on plant-scale,
* Develop and run bench-top formulas for plant-based products, and work with the Director of Food Science to evaluate the next
steps for scaling up and commercialization.
* Run various quality control tests for evaluating the bench-top product quality to create prototypes for investors; present results
effectively to key stakeholders on a regular basis in a timely manner.
* Transformed my role into a communication bridge between Food Science and other departments to strategize and optimize
processes to support the company’s goals.
* Provide hands-on training to other Research Associates in the Food Science lab.
