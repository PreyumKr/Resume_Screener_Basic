results Identify and eliminate performance bottlenecks during the development lifecycle Accurately produce regular project
status reports to senior management to ensure on-time project launch.

« Performed Black Box, White Box, Performance testing , Regression , and Validation testing during the testing life cycle of the
product release.

* Verify that new or upgraded applications meet specified performance requirements.Used to identify the queries which taking
too long and optimize those queries to improve performance for degrading the performance by looking at the resources such as

Available Bytes and Private Bytes.

Metrozone Communications — City, STATE
* Tool Used: JMeter, Manual Testing
* Description: This was a centralized application on Windows xp for loan department of bank, which caters to all type of loan
requests, and after processing stores complete information. In first phase enter loan application and applicant detail except
contract creation. After approval a contract is created with applicant and guarantor. Manual Testing of this application involved
functional testing, UI testing, regression testing as a Black Box tester. Performance testing was done using JMeter.
# Responsibilities :
« Requirement AnalysisTest condition and test case preparation
« Tested all modules for negative testing as well
* Test case execution ManuallyTested the application for 1000 users using JMeter.

* Defect and Issue reporting
