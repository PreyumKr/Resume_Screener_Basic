A teaching position where I can utilize my strengths in communication, motivation, leadership, and problem solving to meet educational goals.
As a dedicated teacher with The Gwinnett County Public School System, I would be honored to have the opportunity broaden my experiences

Thave had the pleasure of teaching for fourteen years, and I am certified to teach grades Pre -K through fifth grade in all academic subjects. I
am looking forward to obtaining a position as an ESOL/EIP teacher or as a 2nd, 3rd,4th or Sth grade teacher working with students of mixed

knowledge base. I would like to continue to lea and share what I have learned while enjoying a new opportunity to gain meaningful and

rewarding occasions within your educational community.

Tconsider the art of teaching to be a gift that I enjoy sharing with others. I am very interested in meeting with you in order to become a part of
