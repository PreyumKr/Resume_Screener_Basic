LEAD DEVELOPER 07/2006 to PRESENT
Dave Ramsey | Franklin, TN

‘+ Architected and implemented the firm's trading API

‘+ [twas written in C++, and supported connections to multiple exchange endpoints

‘+ Itwas responsible for order/position management, routing, and receipt of quote data

‘+ The API also utilized ACE and Boost libraries for common tasks such as event handling, managing
threads, synchronization and socket communication.

‘+ Was designed to minimize dependencies on 3rd party APIs, making migration to different vendors
transparent to client applications

‘+ Itis currently being used in all new client applications

+ Led design and was involved in implementation of a generic n-legged spreading engine.

+ Written in C++, it was built on top of the firm's API, and had an attached C# GUI as the front-end.

‘+ Also involved in ongoing enhancements per trader requests

‘+ The engine has been utilized for trading in CME Eurodollar futures/spreads, equity index futures,
eCBOT treasuries and grains, and the market-making program for Eurodollar packs and bundles to
realize commission rebates

‘+ Managed the department's migration from CME MDP to FIXIFAST, using Wombat API as the quote
vendor.

‘+ Involved in installation and configuration of the Wombat Linux servers, and implemented the in-house
price feeds using Wombat's MAMDA API

+ Led the effort for the technology side of an equity pairs trading system

‘+ Involved in the design and first pass implementation, which used Sterling API and ExcelVBA as the
trading platform

+ Managed the daily tasks of a group of 3 developers.

+ Determined project prioritization, resource allocation, scheduling, and requirements gathering for new
systems,

‘+ Specified coding standards and led code reviews to improve software quality.

+ Also managed the continuous interaction with traders regarding new features and ideas for trades

+ Managed design and development of a front-end used for manual trading.

‘+ The application was written in C#, and provided screens for order placement, book management,
position management, and viewing of market data

+ Italso made use of a NET version of the firm's API

‘+ Was implemented in order to cut costs and overhead by removing the need for 3rd party front-ends.

+ Tracked down performance bottlenecks in the firm's API and middleware libraries, resulting in
recommendations on improving order transaction latency by 1-2 ms.

+ Used Intel Threading Building Blocks (TBB) as the debugging tool

‘+ Implemented a basket trading system for a floor trade in Excel VBA.

‘+ The spreadsheet used Sterling's Activex API and traded approximately 35 - 40 stocks.

TRODING SYSTEMS ANALYST 08/2003 to 07/2006

Belvedere Trading | New York, NY

‘+ Working with a senior trader, implemented a Eurodollar spread trade in Excel

+ The system used VBA and TT XTAPI to quote various Eurodollar futures and spread markets on the
CME.

‘+ Once filled, the system performed simple hedging

+ Designed, developed, and maintained an order routing framework, which was used to create the firm's
trading gateways to TT, eCBOT, CME, Eurex, EurexUS, eSpeed, BrokerTec, Hotspot, INET, and Arca

‘+ Allgateways were written in C++ and managed orders from multiple gray box trading clients.

+ Aproprietary database library was used for order management, allowing for high speed transaction
processing and persistence.

+ Also involved in ongoing trader support and debugging of system issues.

‘+ The direct to market gateways replaced the ongoing monthly cost of various 3rd party systems, such as
GL and Portware, and improved transaction latency by removing extraneous server hops.

‘+ Designed, developed and maintained a market data framework, which was used to create the firm's
feed handlers.

+ Allfeeds were implemented in C++ and provided market data from eCBOT, CME, Eurex, EurexUS,
Speed, BrokerTec, Garban, Hotspot, TT, and INET.

+ The system distributed data over IP multicast.

+ Also developed a C# RTD component that allowed traders to view prices in Excel

‘+ Involved in development and maintenance of the middleware library used to route messages through
the infrastructure.

‘+ Components were developed in C++ and communicated using text and serialized object messages over
‘TCP connections

‘+ The library also included wrappers for OS specific objects, such as threads, locking mechanisms, files,
and sockets

+ Developed an eSpeed smart order router.

‘+ The component received orders from client applications and sent them to multiple eSpeed API
connections using a round robin algorithm

‘+ Was implemented in order to avoid the eSpeed API limitation of having 1 order per price level

+ Developed test components for the exchange gateway servers and client software.

‘+ Using the INET framework, implemented a GUI used for order placement and book management.

+ Used as the front-end tool for certifying direct to market gateways with exchanges, allowing for a more
efficient test cycle.

TWARE ENGINEER/CONSULTANT 07/2000 to 08/2003

‘+ Involved in the design and development of a BOX market data gateway.

‘+ The system was implemented using FIX on the client-side, and used MMTP/HSVF protocols to
communicate with the BOX trading engine

‘+ Was primarily responsible for coding the MMTP/HSVF modules.

‘+ Developed, tested, and supported a server-side gateway of a single stock futures trading system

+ The system was implemented in Java in a Solaris environment, and included both order entry and
market data servers

‘+The Tibco API was used as the client-side transport, and the CBOE CMi API was used to communicate
with the CBOEDirect trading engine.

‘+ The system made use of Tibco fault tolerant libraries to ensure high availability

‘+ Involved in the full software development life cycle, from the creation of design/functional specifications
and UML class/sequence diagrams, to full-scale production rollout.

+ Developed and tested a C++ exchange gateway on NT as part of a futures and options order routing
system

‘+ The system received client messages over server-side socket connections and communicated them to
the CBOT A/CIE and Eurex trading engines, using the VALUES API

‘+ Implemented and tested OLE DB COM interfaces for SQL Server 7 database access

‘+ Also enhanced and maintained an MFC application to be used as a monitoring and admin tool for the
system

+ Designed, developed, and tested a C++ component on Solaris as part of a futures and options order
routing system

and routed it to multiple trading engines using the VALUES API and CBOT OrderDirect.

‘+ Using Rational Rose, also created UML class/sequence diagrams and design specifications.

‘+ Involved in design and development of a C++ order routing gateway product that communicated with the
CBOT AVC/E, Eurex, and Xetra trading engines

packages real-time through distribution warehouses.

‘+ Also involved in the installation, configuration, and on-site support and maintenance of the system

+ Designed, developed, and tested a C++ Activex Data Objects (ADO) component of warehouse
conveyor system and order picking software.

‘+ Maintained and supported a C++ tools library, which included abstractions for file/database logging,
sockets, event handling, and configuration tools such as the Win32 registry.
