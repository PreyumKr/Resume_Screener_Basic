SUMMARY

‘When I began floral design, I was trained on the job with Emporia Floral by wonderful designers. When I moved to the Kansas City area, I
chose to work part time at HyVee floral, so that I could remain in the design field while staying at home with my children during the day. It was
uring this time that I received my FTD Master designer certification. I did not work in a traditional floral shop after HyVVee, however I did
work occasionally with Andrea Grist Floral designs through the years as an occasional designer. Over my years as a floral designer, I attended
design shows, hands-on sessions, competitions, and conferences. I now have my own business doing wedding embroidery, but have grown to

miss floral design, and I am hoping to get back in to floral on a part time basis.
