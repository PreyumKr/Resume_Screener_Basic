SUMMARY

lam a 48 year old Chinese woman, with a bachallor degree in accounting, from the University of
International Business and Economics in Beijing. Last year, | passed USCPA exams as well.

I developed this resume as a way to introduce my somewhat unusual training and experience as
compared to a standard accountant.

Both of my parents are teachers, and they created the expectation that I will keep learning through
‘out my life. So | have taken every opportunities to take on new challenges. And therefore took every
‘opportunities to travel as widely as possible. And thus keep learning at every opportunity.

‘As an example my desire for new experience, instead of taking a safe and conventional job as an
accountant in Chinese business, | did not hesitate to take a position as an assis. A/c in Northern
Telecom Corp., the Canadian company which was one of world’s largest telecornmunication equiptment
manufacturers in the at that time. They had just formed a JV in China as a base for exploration of
‘opportunities in Asia. This proved to be an excellent decision because Nortel created its staffing from
many countries in Asia and North America, so | had the opportunities to work with people from
diverse experience and background at the very early stage of my business career. For example, though
I started as an assit. A/c in BJ, after several years of being exposed to Canadian accounting
practices, | helped in their understanding on Chinese accounting practices. The next experience-
expanding opportunity came when I was included in the group going to vietnam to further expand
nortel’s investment in Asia.| was given speicial responsibilities for working with the Vietnam
taxaztion authorities to ensure that we were in full conformity with local taxation code, for such
matters as cell towers and services.

This experience to go to Vietnam is particularly helpful, working in a new environment, culture,
language, legal & regulorgary Environment.

After these 2months in Vietnam ,| returned to Bj and in following years, several promotions, I was set
to the central a/c group Asia percific located in HK, another opportunity to expand my perspectives.
The nortel experience in BJ HK Vit were very helpful and diversifying my experiences as a beginning
accountant. Unfortunally the Nortel filing for bankruptcy ended the Asian business.

Following the collapse of nortel, | spent 8 years as a financial specialist in Pingan Trust, the largest
Trust company in China.

Iwas assigned to work from two accquired companies: Xuji Group and Jawha Group. | worked as CFO
and GM within the two groups.

|lwas sent to this company, to clean up the fiscal condition of it. For example, they had 11 different
lines of credit with different banks. And because the employees were not accustomed to the urgent
condition. So I had to speed up the processes and make the company ready to be resold. Under the
pressure to get the company prepared to be sold to State Grid Co., the monopoly electricity
distributor, the State Grid made this decision in order to have a more secure and emergency power
available. It had many issues to be solved, | had to go to the CEO frequently, eventually the CEO ....In
that period of time, | learned how to make decisions, and how to motivate my cocoworkers to execute
them. Took on the tough jobs, | am more like a trouble shooter and executor. To be successful, | need
to be acquainted with the varieties of regulations and policies.

The experience with Xuji,was very stimulating, have high level responsibilities.

After the Xuji project, | worked for Shanghai Jahwa as GM to reorganize several projects, sell existing
investments, and expanded into new business areas.

Then I quit from PAT and joined for China Century Group as CFO. CCG is owned by a Chinese
American. | spent 3 years with CCG from 2016. Besides the role as CFO, my duties there more like an
acting operating officer. Because the group is expanding to investment sector, | was more focused on
set up the whole investment operating system, and decision making system.

Currently , | decide to retire from china, live and work from America.

| appreciate this doc is unlike any CV you have never seen, that is because | am unlike any other
candidate you have seen before.

want to give you this berief history to help orient you to my training and background,and happy to
‘answer any questions you might have. Thank you for sharing the information with your .

This brief history is a summary of my experience and your interest in detail is welcome.
