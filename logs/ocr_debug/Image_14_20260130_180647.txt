EXPERIENCE HIGHUGHTS

MAtPats SYSTEMS, Des Moines, Jona
Electrical Enginoer, $2011 ~Prosent
Integral in the design, development, testing of vibration, pressure, fore, gas, and inertial sensors
(Create analog, digital, DIA, A/D, and mixed-signal circuit designs as well as electrical specifications
for new system designs. Actively involved in full life design cycle, from requirement definition
‘through design, prototyping, proof of concept, testing, and interface implementation; outline and
develop validation test plans. Co-author comprehensive suppart documents for Fabrication,
Integrated Cireuit (IC) Design, PCB Design, and ASIC Design teams, Interface with internal
customers and external production / mechanical engineering teams.
Seketed Contributions:
+ Saved potentially thousands in production costs by identifying strategic improvements to
product life eycleduring the New Preduct Development (NPD) process.
+ Triggered 25% increase in sensor reliability by developing testing validation procedures
* Played key role in ensuring team efforts met—and often exereded—all nancial,
performance, quality, and reliability goals.
