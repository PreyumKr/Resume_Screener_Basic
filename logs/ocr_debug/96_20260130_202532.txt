SUMMARY

First and foremost - I am a nerd. I love new technologies and I love learning about them. I have been modding video games almost as long as
Tve been playing them, and I am no stranger to dissecting processes I don't yet understand. I have been an employee of Nike for 13 years, and
my joumey in this awesome company has continually led me closer to the things that I truly enjoy.

In my personal time over the years, I've learned programs like Photoshop, 3DS Max, After Effects, and Premier - to create custom content for
‘games and produce high quality imagery/videos to communicate the content to consumers. In my professional time, I've leamed 3D modeling,

materializing and rendering - to create high quality representations of footwear concepts for design gates and presentations

Tam a fast leamer, I have a lot of relevant experience, and I am so excited about the opportunity to take part in Immersive Technologies.
Between my program proficiencies and my demonstrated ability to adapt to new processes, believe that I would be a valuable asset to the

Immersive Team as they blaze a new trail for Nike.

EXPERIENCE

 

3D Designer 1, 05/2018 - Current

Nike — City, STATE

In 2018, I was promoted to 3D Designer 1. VS support had reached the end of its life span and I committed my time wholly to 3D and DPC. I
‘was assigned as support to GFB and continued previous 3D duties, as well as starting in-line modeling for design gates. After publishing 5 GFB
shoes to Unreal for our first all-digital SL, I helped lay out the pipeline and learnings for our second all-digital SL, leaning a huge amount
about things that run the gamut in our profession - file management and naming, texture map baking, version control, Unreal project creation’

management, real time material creation, modeling and UV'ing best practices, and more.

Relatively recently, I was reassigned to the Women's category, where I continued all previous duties, including exploration of new creative

exercises and some fun photoshop mashups of rendered models on Instagram influencers.

3D Production Designer, 05/2017 - 05/2018

Nike — City, STATE

Jn 2017, Iwas promoted to 3D Production Designer, which included all previous responsibilities and incorporated more help for the CMG)
Pegasus team in their footwear model creation and updating. I became partial support for the CMG team and helped prepare created footwear
models for the CMG app, following modeling standards and program limitations to produce fast, high quality renders. I also began taking on
more projects for categories -making multiple models, RP parts, and renders for Sketch Reviews, Design Reviews, and Creative Launch.

During this time, also expanded my learning to Modo and adapted my modeling process to a new program. I began testing Nike made scripts
and plug-ins, as well as outside programs like Colorway for utilizing created models for color and material application.

Digital Artist/Image Editor, 01/2008 - 05/2017

Nike — City, STATE

Iwas responsible for processing and publishing 2D footwear imagery to VS - a color and materials design tool. By the end of 2015, we had
branched out to full head to toe imagery, flyknit lay-flats, retail storefront visualization, and equipment. I was also responsible for creating
material and color palettes for VS, and accurately matching them to reality.

In 2015 I was promoted to Digital Artist and began taking on 3D modeling projects in addition to my responsibilities to VS. I taught myself
polygonal modeling in Maya (with a lot of help from peers), became familiar with programs like ZBrush, Cinema 4D, and Magics to make
materials and textures, complex parts, and air-tight models for printing. I provided modeling support and testing for CMG, materials creation in
‘Vizoo and X-Rite, and support for pipelines involving the potential production of 3D footwear models.
