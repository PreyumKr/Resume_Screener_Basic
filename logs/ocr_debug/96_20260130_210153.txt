Motion Recruitment | Carlsbad, CA

‘+ Maintaining daily bill cycle run for Voice, Data and SMS modules for Verizon customers
‘+ Implement several code changes to the Python modules running Voice, Data and SMS which includes
but not limited to addition of new functionalities, bug fixes and performance improvements
‘+ Responsible for deploying enhanced code bases into production servers in the Data centers respective
to the modules.
‘+ Team lead for project which implements billing of Phase 3 customers for Voice module, which is an
additional new functionality
‘+ Responsible for delivering billing module of Voice Phase 3 and monitoring the testing team in testing
the entire module.
+ Responsible for implementing low latency SQL which does not overload the production databases as
the load will be huge.

M/GHINE LEARNING ENGINEER 05/2017 to 11/2019

Viasat Inc. | Dallas, TX

‘+ Developed machine learning model which predicts the risk of a person being affected by sepsis during
visit to the hospital.

‘+ Developed a deep neural network to predict the readmission probability of a person with in 7 days and
30 days of their visit to the hospital

‘+ Built a recommendation system which recommends a level of dosage of a medicine for a person
affected with pneumonia, diabetes, and blood pressure using recurrent neural networks (LSTM
networks),

‘+ Developed a image recognition model using openCV and CNN, which recognizes the readings in a
digital machine reading picture by isolating the digital reading from the picture.

‘+ Experience in working with different supervised and unsupervised, machine learning algorithms.

‘+ Experience in implementing different deep learning algorithms using network architectures like feed
forward neural network, convolutional neural network, recurrent neural network,

+ Experience in using openCV to achieve wide variety of computer vision tasks mostly related to but not
limited to health care

‘+ Experience in using different machine learning libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Scipy,
Tensorflow, Keras, XGBoost, NLTK, Computer vision libraries like OpenCV and imageio.

‘+ Experience in using different data visualization libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn and Bokeh.

‘+ Built a resume suggestion tool which sorts and filters out the best possible candidate for a position
based on the job description and the applicants resume using Natural Language Processing (NLP)
techniques like Sequence labeling, Name entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging and word
‘embeddings for internal use of our recruitment team.

‘+ Built plugins using flask which connects the database of resumes and data of job descriptions to use
with the applications.

+ Built a basic UI for resume suggestion tool using Flask and integrated all the plugins for easy on non
commercial use, which in turn increase the productivity of the recruitment team.

+ The machine learning models which i worked on are being used in ios and android application called
myHFB,
