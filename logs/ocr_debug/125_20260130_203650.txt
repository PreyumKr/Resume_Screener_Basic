Epucation

 

Associate of Arts: Business Administration

Cerritos College - Norwalk, CA.

For this career choice, I did chose something that will help me in my present and future ventures. I do believe this choice gave me the tools to
be able to lean about the general overview of how to run any business office. I leamed about the importance of accounting for a business and
knowing how to read a ledger and make healthy financial orders. I also learned the ideal ways to write a contract and to make it a successful
agreement for both parties, especially yours. During this time, I participated in a lot of school events and performances that made me open my
mind up to leaming new things and leaving fears behind leading my team to be successful and proud recitals, speeches and learning
conventions for our own peers

08/2011 High School Diploma
Lennox Academy - Inglewood, CA
My High school was a school I choose the battle to get admission to. Thad to go through a series of tests, interviews,
and essays to attend. Lennox academy was my high school of choice for many reasons but mainly for being a Green
DOT school, one of the highest SAT scoring schools to this day in the State, and being a charter high school. One of my
favorite things was one of the school's focus which was teaching us about finances, business, with personal accounting
courses, musical and theatrical performances produced and created by the students that I was proud to be part of. In
more importance anther focus for the school was included Math, Science, technology and art
