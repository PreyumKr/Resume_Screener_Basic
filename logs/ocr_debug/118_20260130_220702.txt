with a Spanish Education background eager to resume a full-time teaching career. Qualities entail a passion for educating ELL
learners and a sincere commitment to seeing student and school success. March 9, XXX5 To Whom It May Concern, While living in
Chicago among the most diverse population in the United States, I discovered my life's passion, teaching. Now, after twenty plus
years of working with and investing in ELLs, Iam realizing my dream of teaching full-time. Excitement and elation are not even
close to what I experience when I take part in guiding students into an ever changing world of language, whether it be English or
foreign. Nor can I imagine or fathom doing anything other than educating students in the development and love of English grammar
and its usage. It is for these reasons coupled with life experience, volunteer service, and college training which makes me an ideal
candidate for any teaching position. Yet, I understand being the best person for the job requires more than mere desire, but demands
the blending of similar values, common goals, and hard work. Sharing this with others of like-mindedness will enable me to fulfill
my passion for both teaching and seeing scholars succeed. Sincerely, Catherine Claire Catherine Claire Dedicated ESL teacher with a
