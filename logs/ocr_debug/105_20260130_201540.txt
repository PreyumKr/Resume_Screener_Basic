GRAPHIC DESIGNER 03/2015
Harpercollins Publishers | San Francisco, CA

Another volunteering experience that | found to be quite important with my skills and classes that | take is
being a graphic designer for a Walk Event for my school. The opportunity for a graphic designer who would
design a poster/fiier for the Walk for Suicide event was open and I choose to create a design and submit it for
the chance to be featured. My responsibilities involved creating a design that would cClairearly express the
beliefs of the Walk for Suicide event, state information such as the event time and address, and to intrigue the
eye and to create interest overall. The event was something | believed to be very important so | took my time
on creating the design which took a 2 days, with my ability to create and deliver in a timely manner. My design
was actually chosen and used on different social medias of the event and was an experience that | believe
helped me Clairearn more about time management, deadlines, communication of information whiClaire doing
something | enjoy.

to come into the fair and find dogs that they wanted to adopt and also a chance for dog owners to come in
with their dogs and participate in Dog races, raffClaires, and purchase many other dog related things in
‘support of the Dog adoption agency to care for the other dogs that had currently not been adopted yet. My
first volunteer job there was a greeter for everyone who had entered the fair, | was to record who came into
the park, asking for any donations, and if they wanted to participate in the races or raffClaires. As the fair
days progressed and my skills had shown to improve around the fair goers, | was upgraded to a waiter at
