Summary

 

Before I was a professional, I am an Individual who Kenly respects the value of aspiration. Surely, life would be vain without purpose. As a
Christian, 'm morally compelled to strive and press the boundaries of my faculties. My best efforts demonstrate my truest value, given that an
outcome is merely the result of an initiative. If a man is driven to produce substance, he can never be the only beneficiary. Considering that he
cannot inhale and exhale simultaneously, he must assume that there is a purpose to the order. As I receive oxygen I must give carbon dioxide
in order to continue living and thrive. It is this purpose that drives my every motive, the principle that inspires me to excell both personally
and professionally. "Freely you have received, freely give.” This does not indicate that the challenge will always be within my competency, so
I must remind myself that "A ready and persevering spirit even met with opposition will learn the hardest of lessons, though it may take
seasons to learn." ~Iessica Cato C. So yes, as a Graphic Designer, Support consultant and humble worker, I aspire to soon wear many other
hats in service to my fellow men, with the deliberation and purpose of a Christian.
