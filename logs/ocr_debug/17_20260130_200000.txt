WORK HISTORY

Lumeris - Data Science - Technical Leader
Oklahoma, PAindia + 04/2022 - 12/2022

+ Delivered innovative, high-performing and scalable analytical software solutions meeting business
needs.

+ Worked closely with cross-functional team involving data scientists, product manager and product
‘owner to translate business needs to technical specifications.

+ Acted as technical consultant for muttiple teams.

+ Developed dash app with Genetic Algorithm for part supply chain to identify near-optimal economic
order quantity such that service level is maximized, inventory position and number of shipments
are minimized.

+ Built streamlit app for survival analysis of automobile service parts.

+ Created Qliksense dashboard to track signal when vehicle faces some damages/crash and highlight
cost information related part replacement /repair.

Ford Motor Private Limited India - Data Scientist - Product Owner
City, STATEIndia « 08/2020 - 03/2022

+ Contributed to company’s key strategic decision making through analytic solutions and products
developed, resulting in huge cost savings and better global production planning.

+ Proposed heuristic approach for smart inventory management system to reduce computation time
of large-scale mixed integer linear programming model from 45 minutes to 2 seconds.

+ Designed and implemented robust, scalable optimization model for optimal allocation of semi
conductor chips to different vehicle lines thereby saving $78 million dollar for four weeks.

+ Performed sensitivity analysis to analyze robustness of existing solution and make further purchase
and planning decisions.

+ Eliminated manual efforts by automating results storage following each optimization algorithm run
using python.

+ Developed business critical visualization solutions using Qlikview, Qliksense and Tableau.

+ Mentored and groomed team members on technical know-hows and operationalized multiple
projects.

+ Conducted Tech Talk and knowledge share sessions.

‘Mercedes-Benz Research And Development India - Principal Data Scientist
City, STATEIndia « 11/2016 - 07/2020

+ Designed, developed, and supported Operations Research applications to solve complex and
business problems for Europe Production Planning team.

+ Identified stable buying pattern of customers over time for automobile industry. These identified
rules increased part demand prediction by 13.4% compared to existing algorithm.

+ Developed software application to automate process of stable rules generation using C#.

+ Built predictive models and machine learning algorithms for Attribute Take rates prediction and
battery life prediction.

+ Implemented plant capacity and demand allocation problem as multi-commodity network flow
problem to allocate vehicles to different plants considering real time and dynamic constraints.

+ Developed C# application and Tableau reports to track changes in attributes and parts of car
scheduled for production to reduce emergency part shipments and identify volatile attributes/
parts.

+ Implemented time series models like exponential regression and Auto-regression to predict battery
life (time left to complete discharge of battery) of battery car.
