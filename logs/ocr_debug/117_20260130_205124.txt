with business users and development staff like business analysts, data architects, back-end solutions developers, testers, DBA and
application developers to understand/determine requirements for on time delivering and with scalability. Worked extensively with
T-SQL and building OLTP/OLAP databases at conceptual, logical and physical design levels, normalizing and de-normalizing
database tables for efficient relationships operation and analytic through ER diagrams and Erwin. Strong RDBMS concepts and
experience in creating and maintaining database objects, views, stored procedures, triggers, functions, indexes, and constraints. Wide
experience in building static, dynamic and interactive reports; dashboards and story, report templates and formatting using BIDS
and Report Builder. Experienced in data cleansing, accuracy and completeness validation, analysis, and modeling relationship.
Experienced with full development cycle of a DWH, including requirements gathering design, implementing, and maintenance.
Experienced in ETL solutions that extract data from heterogeneous sources like Access, Excel, and CSV, flat files using connectors,
tasks and transformations provided by SSIS. Proficient in creating dynamic SSIS packages for Incremental Loads and used change
data capture (CDC) control task that makes efficient data loading. Experienced in Configuring Batch Logging, Error Logging, event
handlers and Connection Managers in SSIS. Developed, configured, deployed and monitored SSIS packages for development, testing
and production with parameter and environment variables and scheduled job in SQL Server Agent. Experienced in designing
Enterprise Star-Schema, Snowflakes, and OLAP cubes. Experienced in database server performance tuning and optimization of
Complex SQL queries. An excellent team player and technically strong person who has capability to work with business users,
