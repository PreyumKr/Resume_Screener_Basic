With almost twenty years of experience in recruitment and human resources development, I have the skills, talent
and experience to transform your team’s effectiveness in recruitment, and ultimately, performance. My legacy of
supporting organizations in developing a culture that is self-selective, and based on competence, experience andthe
right fit of talents, attests to my passion for recruitment, which is rooted in a fascination with observing and
understanding human beings in organisations. My belief in empowerment, with agency, transcends organizational
culture; I believe it is the leverage point for social change in the 21st century.
