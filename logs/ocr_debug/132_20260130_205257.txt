EXPERIENCE

 

05/2020 to Current Senior Data Engineer
Factset Research Systems Inc. — Norwalk, CT
Responsible for building data pipelines and provide quality data services to data science team to build AI/ML models
with agile development environment.

* Build AVML prediction model of account take over by evaluating the customer behavior to determine if an event
related to address, email, phone, credit card, or paper check is a fraudulent activity. This real time model will
improve the fraud detection by 30% and result in annual benefit of around $9,000,000 for the company. This
model handles event activities from over 65 million customers.

 

‘© Gather requirements from the business (stakeholders/SMEs), communicate and translate requirements between
cross functional technology teams(data science, data engineering, IT, database)

‘+ Implement and automate data pipelines framework using PySpark, Spark SQL, and Python in distributed cluster
computing using IBM Spectrum Cluster and enterprise Data Lake.

‘+ Implement streaming and batch processing process with structured and unstructured data for the real-time ML
fraud detection model using lambda architecture.

‘+ Implement data pipeline framework with bronze, silver, bronze layers to hierarchically manage the data flow of the
raw data source to final data target location.

‘© Improve the data pipeline runs in the distributed computing by exploring the cluster, jobs, tasks and executors using
Spark and Application UL

+ Implement data validation module using SQL (Oracle, Teradata), Python and PySpark that automatically
compares column level, row level, and metadata metrics from database and data lakes tables. This helped the team
to accelerate the validation process by 95%.

‘* Document model development, data architecture, data pipelines for both business and technical needs.
