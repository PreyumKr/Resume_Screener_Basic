BIOLOGICAL SCIENCE LABORATORY TECHNICIAN (GS7) 07/2020 to CURRENT

UsDA-Agricultural Research Service | City, STATE

‘+ Generate data, reports, and protocols that contribute to the characterization/detection of quarantine
pathogens. Protocols include isolation of viruses, nucleic acids and proteins, detection of pathogens by
serological assays (ELISA and Western blotting), nucleic acids by polymerase chain reaction PCR-
based assays (conventional PCR/RT-PCR), and host symptomatology.

‘+ Adapt new technologies in RNA isolation, prepare cDNA libraries for high throughput genome analysis,
and maintain Next-generation sequence (NGS) databases

‘+ Apply molecular cloning methodologies (PCR/RT-PCR cloning and cDNA library construction) and
perform basic sequence analysis such as quality trim, assembly, and BLAST search for viral genomic
sequence, genetic diversity, and viral confirmation

+ Record and document all testing in laboratory notebook and e-format as well as summarizing results
using software such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint on a regular basis.

‘+ Apply standard Python and Bash scripts to manage and maintain NGS and Sanger sequence
databases, additionally, regularly utilize CLC Genomics Workbench to analyze sequence data

+ Propagate and maintain a variety of host plants in growth chambers, greenhouses, & screenhouses for
collections and inoculations of viral plant pathogens.

‘+ Responsible for procuring laboratory, greenhouse, and office supplies, as well as, boosted team
efficiency by maintaining inventory of chemicals, consumables, and equipment.

‘+ Research literature to keep abreast of molecular biological advancements, technology, and plant
pathogens.

‘+ Maintain equipment and instruments in top working condition, performing routine maintenance and
calibrations, and reporting signs of malfunction and need for repair.

BICLOGICAL SCIENCE AID (GS6) 08/2019 to 06/2020
UsDA-Agricultural Research Service | City, STATE

+ Coordinate and manage plant sample collection, preparation, and evaluation from greenhouse and field
projects.

‘+ Operate and maintain specialized laboratory equipment, instruments, and automated systems for
recurring experimental procedures that aid in plant research

‘+ Propagate and maintain experimental plants under specific greenhouse and growth chamber
conditions.

* Conduct regular viral and fungal inoculations and maintain viable cultures for experimental replication.

+ Perform RNA/DNA extractions, (both conventional and real-time) RT-PCRIPCR, and gel electrophoresis.

‘+ Experience with Co-Immunoprecipitation to identify protein-protein interactions.

+ Evaluated and prepared data for basic calculations and statistical analysis of experimental results,
utilizing Rstudio

‘+ Quickly learned new skills and applied them to daily tasks, improving efficiency and productivity.

MIGSTER’S GRADUATE RESEARCH ASSISTANT 08/2016 to 08/2019

University Of Nebraska-Lincoln | City, STATE

+ Work involved plant material collection, viral and fungal DNA/RNA extractions, and performing
conventional PCR/RT-PCR and serological assay (ELISA) tests for pathogen detection.

‘+ Managed multiple student workers to complete projects in a timely manner and maintain laboratory
resources

+ Complete various projects in collaboration with multiple research groups.

‘+ Maintained fungal, viral, and nematode cultures as inoculum sources for experiments

+ Collected and maintained data from disease evaluations and organized data utilizing computer
packages such as word processor and excel spreadsheet.

+ Utilized computer programs such as RStudio and S.A.S for statistical analysis (.¢. ANOVA and means
comparisons), and effectively communicate research findings through written and oral communication

+ Maintained laboratory notebooks, recorded methods and procedures used, and noted any procedural
modifications, observations, and results obtained from experiments.

PLONT & PEST DIAGNOSTIC CLINIC LAB ASSISTANT 04/2015 to 08/2016
University Of Nebraska-Lincoln | City, STATE
‘+ Assisted in diagnosing plant pathogens and plant deficiencies based on symptom expression.
+ Coordinated molecular diagnostics via DNA/RNA extraction and purification, conventional PCRIRT-PCR,
gel electrophoresis, and BLAST-based analysis.
‘+ Performed serological tests for the identification of fungi, bacteria, and viruses (ie. ELISA tests, lateral-
flow chromatography).
‘+ Isolated and maintained fungal and bacterial cultures using classical techniques
‘+ Maintained sterile and clean work environment, operated autoclave to ensure sterilization when
necessary.
‘+ Prepared a variety of media (Ie. NBY, H2O agar, PDA, and specialized media).
‘+ Utilized microscopes (compound and dissecting) to provide morphological ID of plant pathogens in
culture.
‘+ Kept data log of samples to monitor plant disease epidemiological trends in Nebraska
