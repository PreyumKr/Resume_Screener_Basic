ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

Project Details
MME. Applied Electronics -2009
Title- Area Efficient FIR Filters For High Speed FPGA Implementation

Description : A new algorithm that synthesizes multiplier blocks with low hardware requirement

suitable for implementation as part of full-parallel finite impulse response (FIR) filters is presented.

Although the techniques in use are applicable to implementation on application-specific integrated

circuit (ASIC) and Structured ASIC technologies, analysis is performed using field programmable gate

array (FPGA) hardware.

B.E, Electronics & Instrumentation Engineering-2003

Title - High Speed Data Acquisition system for Military Purpose (Real time

Implementation of “High speed voltage variations”)

Description - The emphasis is laid on voltage variations. It is achieved the efficiency of the sonobouy

battery using a micro controller chip and give the user Correct state of sonobouy.

Done at - Orbit Controls & Services Pvt Ltd. Chennai.

Visiting Scientist : Jul 2018 to Jan 2023

Title : Fully automatic system for measuring broiler body temperature

Hardware\Software : Arduino, Raspberry pi, Python, MATLAB.

Application : This real-time temperature monitoring system can provide alerts or notifications to the

poultry farm manager or veterinarian if any significant deviations from the normal temperature range

are detected.

Title : Tree cooling system

Hardware\Software : Datalogger/ ThermaCAM Researcher v2.10

Application : The automated system ensures that the trees receive adequate moisture, contributing

to their growth, vitality, and overall well-being.

Title : Cow database and analysis

Hardware\Software : Python

Application : Specialized Python software platforms are designed to handle this data efficiently and

provide analytical tools for extracting valuable insights like Performance Monitoring, Reproductive

‘Management and Operational Optimization.

Title : Semiautomatic rumination detection

Hardware\Software : Python

Application : Python programming to detect rumination in audio data received from a cattle’s collar

equipped with sensors that can detect the movements and sounds associated with rumination, such as

chewing and swallowing.
