GRADUATE SCHOOL- THESIS ABSTRACT

+ Tanalyze the impact of the level of blockholders on firm performance. Specifically, I estimate the relationship between the level of firm
blockholders and excess returns of the firm using the Fama-French Three-Factor Model and six different group categories of block
ownership level. The results of this study indicate that there exists a non-monotonic relationship between blockholders level and firm
performance. I find relatively higher performance for firms with moderate levels of blockholders and relatively lower performance for
firms with low (or no) blockholders or high level of blockholders. This suggests that there may exist an optimal level of blockholders.
