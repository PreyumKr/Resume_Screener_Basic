EXPERIENCE

Paypal - DevOps Engineer
Charlotte, NC + 01/2019 - Current

 

+ Deployed the Connect/Harmony Suite of products (https: //explorer.factorn.com) to Kubernetes,
‘App Engine and leveraged other GCP tools to build distributed, scalable systems.

+ Administered and maintained the Blockchain network for FactomD - including working to resolve
pauses; made changes and additions to manage any issues on the network

+ Redesigned and created the “DevNet” which is a tool for developers to quickly spin up small
FactomD networks, with working blockchains - in order to test the protocol

+ Developed a restart interface through AWS, leveraging proper security groups, EC2 instances, load
balancers and Google oAuth authentication within a lua-openresty image that would track requests
and regulate the frequency of blockchain network restarts.

+ Developed helm charts that deployed automated backups for the blockchain - to stop followers that
were synced with the blockchain, and copy the database to a GCS bucket.

+ Deployed and maintained a distributed monitoring system (the Factom Overview)for all the nodes
in the blockchain, using websockets, React and NodeJS and required successful routing between
networks in multiple providers and instances.

+ Developed an automation in kubernetes for the Ephemeral Sandbox - this scales down the pods
using the blockchain, wipes the database of the blockchain from the leader nodes, restarts the
network from the first block, and starts the Connect API pods so it’s available for use.

Legalzoom - Staff Systems Engineer
Casper, WY » 11/2017 - 12/2018

+ Started quickly and learned by “drinking from the firehose” - to quickly become a key figure in
supporting an enterprise Container as a Service infrastructure: a self-service system for customers
to request containerized Redis instances that are load-balanced, and highly available within a
luster of ephemeral VMs. Architect for the automation of the ephemeral refresh. Added APIS to
interface with Splunk logging.

+ Acted as architect and created a ground-breaking application for self-service provisioning of open
source databases. Using NodeJS and Python | created “DBaaS” (Database as a Service) which
allows self-service for developers to provision and manage a plethora of DB types from a single
pane of glass.

+ Lead the implementation of a UI that would activate Terraform modules built for the DBaas
platform to provision the requested elements.

+ Driving force for adding features for self-service database service - provisioning, password reset,
and user maintenance. Responsible for engineering the solution for each requirement.

+ The DBaaS platform uses NodeJS, Mongo, and Redis that handles requests from users, provisions
the requested databases on multiple platforms, tickets the requests in Service Now (adds notes for
provisioning on failure/ or closes on success), enters tracking information to a MariaDB repository
- and then pushes the data to a graphical interface on the frontend. A Redis PUBSUB channel and
lists are used for each microservice to synchronize with each other, and pass data along to each
modular stage of the process. Very expandable, robust, and highly available,

+ Team subject matter expert for Kubernetes, Docker, automation and coding - always willing to help
and provide tools for my teammates.

+ Akey member of the “Store of the Future” Home Depot team: to re-architect a new micro-service
approach to all retail store data-services: using Kubernetes, Helm and a number of container
applications to maximize work for application teams.
