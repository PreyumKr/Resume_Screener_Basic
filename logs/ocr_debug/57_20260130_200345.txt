SUMMARY

Experienced physicist with a strong background in research and development particularly in the field of solid state physics which involves
synthesis and engineering of nanomaterials (size, shape and surface area through different synthesis techniques and reagents). In-depth
knowledge of solid state physics, mathematics, optics, electronics and theoretical physics. Capable of applying complex physical concepts and
calculations in various environments. capable of working alone or with other research scientists. Extensive research training has been acquired
uring post-graduate education and Phd course work. Have gained hands-on experience in characterizing nanomaterials using various
characterization techniques including PXRD, FTIR, UV-Visible spectrometer, Raman spectrometer and SEM. Adopted an eco- friendly method
of synthesis technique by using plant extracts as fuels for combustion and hydrothermal synthesis of nanomaterials. Exclusively worked on
synthesis and doping of Titanium dioxide and Vanadium pentoxide throughout the research career. An efficient way of aking e-Bricks where e-
waste was used as coarse aggregate. A patent has been granted by the government of INDIA for the uniqueness of “A METHOD FOR
SYNTHESIZING A COMPOSITION FOR A LIGHT-EMITTING DIODE LIGHT". Diligent Research Intern organized in handling
documentation, recordkeeping and data analysis. Skilled in enhancing research with accuracy and precision. Dedicated to executing protocols to

meet study objectives and requirements.
