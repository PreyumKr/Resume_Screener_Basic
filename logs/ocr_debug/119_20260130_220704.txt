Work History

Drug Testing Coordinator, 05/2010 to Current

Cazoo - City, STATE

Coordinate, train, advise, and facilitate the drug testing for the Mississippi Amy National Guard. Which consist of 10,000 Soldiers. Maintaining
all the necessary data, equipment, and supplies needed for the program is a big part of my job. Also, I assist any Soldier, Commander, ot Judicial
Staff in any drug related questions. I serve as the State's subject matter expert on drug testing, which would include testifying during drug
separation boards/trials.

2-114th I served as the Platoon Sergeant and for the 185th I serve as the FIRES Non-Commission Officer, 07/2008 to Current
2-114th Field Artillery Unit, Starkville MS And 185th TAB Aviation Unit, Jackson MS

For the 2-1]4th I served as the C.O.L.T. (Combat Observation Lasing Team) Platoon Sergeant. We trained to spot the enemy and radio in their
location so that the Field Artillery guns could have a good effect on target. We deployed to Iraq in March of 2009 as a Route Clearance and
Convoy Security Unit. This induded surveying all supply routes in our area for IEDs (Improvised Explosive Devices), road/bridge conditions,
civilian activity, and any other activity that could affect the mission. We also participated in Convoy Security for 18 wheeler supply trucks that
‘were moving from base to base.

For the 185th, which is a helicopter aviation unit, I serve in the FIRES Cell. Our job is to monitor all Field Artillery operations and advise our
Planning Cell on where pilots not to fly. The goal is to keep Army helicopters from flying through Field Artillery Fire, We deployed to Kuwait in
February of 2014. There was no Artillery being fired so I served as the Aviation Liaison Officer between ARCENT (Army Central Command a
division of CENTCOM) and our aviation unit. I was available to ARCENT to assist them in contacting specific aviation personnel they may have
questions for. Also part of my job was to assist any of our units personnel who might be coming through my base for transit back to the US. This
included providing them with temporary housing (if needed), transportation to and from the flight line, and any other needs they might have.
