Some people say, "A jack of all trades is a master of none." I respectfully disagree, arguing that a master
craftsman isn't identified by a specified trade, but rather by their ability to bring a diverse range of concepts
from imagination into reality. | am an individual who prides myself on my work. | am a craftsman. The final
result of a finished job, the efficiency of the task, and the preparation of the project are all key factors which
build my work ethic to the basis which | hold myself. As | grow, | am learning to use many different experiences
of my life to aid new ways of thinking and problem solving. | am a team player, | am a dynamic thinker, | am a
strong worker and I have a passion to enter a career setting | will enjoy and thrive in. My past mentors and
instructors all seem to have identified a similar pattern in me; | learn fast, | understand what needs to be done,
and | take pride in impressing people with my hard work and attention to detail. | think | will be a valuable
addition to your team, and | think that working with you will be very beneficial for myself as well. Thank you for
your consideration.
