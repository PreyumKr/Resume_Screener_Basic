ACCOMPLISHMENTS

 

‘As aself taught one man furniture design/build workshop, Iam most proud of the fact that during my 25 year career of building custom
furniture, several of my projects were featured in local magazines, a national magazine, as well as featured on a TV show in 2001.

In 2014, at the age of 44, I decided to pivot from my career since I was 18 years old and go into construction project management. And over
the past seven years working with a developer, I managed the construction of two 16 million dollar homes in Miami Beach. Utilizing my
knowledge of home renovations and furniture building, I ensured all the details were at their highest level, thus resulting in two unique
showpieces.
