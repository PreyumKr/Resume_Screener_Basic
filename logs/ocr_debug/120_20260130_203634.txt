ApprTIonaL INFORMATION

 

What I have are a very particular set of skills. Skills Ihave acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a dream for a company like
you.

Thave a sense of humor to go along with my diverse employment history. I believe my experience in multiple industries provides a unique
perspective, which will be a valuable asset in a leadership role. As an Iragi- American woman, I have fought hard to be treated fairly and I
will continue to do so in order to show little girls, like my daughter, that women's ideas are valuable and being in a high level position is
possible. We don't see many women of color in high-level positions because of trust, and that trust starts with you trusting that a woman like
me can and will be an exceptional leader.
