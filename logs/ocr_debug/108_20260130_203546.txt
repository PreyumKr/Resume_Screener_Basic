PROFEssIONAL SUMMARY

 

I've spent the last 12 years in Los Angeles working in entertainment, health, and fitness. Health and wellness has naturally always been a huge
part of my life. Helping others to meet goals, and watching their success has always brought happiness to my life.

I received my CPT and Fitness Nutrition Specialist certification from The National Academy of Sports Medicine (NASM) and received my
certification for Holistic Nutrition and Health Coaching from AFPA (American Fitness Professionals Association). Ihave been working in
Social media and marketing for the last six year for various brands in Los Angeles, while training my personal clients for the last year. After
many years of marketing management, I am excited and ready to expand my journey in health and wellness in Portland.
