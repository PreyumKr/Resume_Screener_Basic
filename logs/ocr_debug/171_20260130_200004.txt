Summary

 

Tam a retired college teacher who has lived in Summit County for more than ten years. I taught at a community college, which means Thad
students with a variety of ethnic and cultural backgrounds, a wide range of academic ability and writing skills, and differing levels of curiosity
and motivation. Teaching this group of students was challenging and required a variety of communication skills~an enthusiasm for the
subject, a genuine rapport with students, and an ability to clearly explain the material being covered.

Thave been active in the Summit county community. I was a member of the Summit County Library Board for five years, serving as its
president for one of those years. I was also a member of the Library Foundation for seven years, working mainly to raise funds for a much
larger library in Breckenridge. I have been a volunteer for a variety of public service groups, including the Keystone Adaptive Ski Program,
the Colorado Fourteeners Initiative, and the Romp to Stomp out breast cancer.
