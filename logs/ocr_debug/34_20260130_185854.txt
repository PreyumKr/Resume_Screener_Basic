SUMMARY

Me as a person I have worked two types of jobs retail, and warehouse. By far I would have to say I would enjoy waking up to go work retail
rather than being not to excited to go to work for Amazon or Fed Ex. That is because what I've always felt [had a strong point with

communicating very well and being a very approachable person, which I feel makes me great for retail having to deal with so many different

 

people with different backgrounds and different beliefS, however we are all so similar in many ways which brings us all together. You honestly
never know what kind of day someone is having and just by being nice and helping them out can really go a long way. So I try my best to
engage with the guest and read body language and how they respond so I know how to interact with different people because no two people are
the same, so ultimately the goal is to make the guest feel comfortable as possible, then help them find what it is they are looking for. In life I
would love and it's my dream to become a therapist, counselor, or and social worker The goal is to help as many people as I possibly can and
that is why love working what I do right now with the guest making them happy and making sure my team members, co worker, managers,
leads, and really everyone happy.
