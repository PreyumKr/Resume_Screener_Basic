ACCOMPLISHMENTS

+ Neural Network Using Different Descent Methods 3-layer neural network is implemented using back
propagation algorithm.

+ Iteration count required to converge is found using 3-fold cross validation Weight parameters are
updated using batch and stochastic gradient descent methods.

+ Effects of using variable learning rate to attain faster convergence rate is also observed.

+ Accuracy of the neural network is computed using two datasets, iris, and car evaluation.

+ Decision Tree Using ID3 Algorithm Decision tree is generated using ID3 algorithm to classify data.

+ Attributes with higher information gain is placed on top of the tree.

+ Pruning is implemented to improve the accuracy of the decision tree.

+ Accuracy of the rules generated before and post-pruning is computed using two datasets, iris, and
car evaluation.
