© GPA: 3.43
© Unique courses: Plasticity & Metal Forming, GD&T, Lean Manufacturing, Biomechanics

Projects

Project Leader, Rehabilitative Exoskeleton, UC Denver.

Led senior design team of 7 to successfully design and manufacture rehabilitative pneumatic

leg exoskeleton. Project won Senior Design Competition of Spring 2014

© Organized team, defined/achieved tasks and deadlines, created BOM, managed budget

© Defined customer requirements such as device weight of no more than 60 lb, cost of no
more than $3000, and joint ranges of motion

o Programmed in MATLAB with motion capture data to determine dynamic joint data

Utilized SolidWorks with FEA to design over 15 parts with target safety factor of 2.5

Designed ankle joint that mimicked human ankle torque and range of motion to within 5%

and 7% respectively

oo

Manufacturing Specialist, Pure Bending Moment Device, UC Denver.
Manufacturing specialist on team of 4 working closely with professor that successfully designed
and manufactured pure bending moment device to measure strain and torque on sheet metal

© Programmed CAM files from solid models which were then used with CNC mills and lathe
to machine over 20 different parts. Drawings detailed with GD&T

© Measured small strains with strain gauge and large final strain with interferometry

© Used LabVIEW and torque transducer with 0.28 sensitivity to calculate bending moment

© Experimental moment values from device were predicted by plasticity theory within 10%

Personal Robotics Project, Interactive Table-top Map.
Programming with Arduino/Python to develop an interactive, projected-image table-top map
