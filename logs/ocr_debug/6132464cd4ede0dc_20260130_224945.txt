Band Stop Filter
+ Asa group project for Flectonic Circuit Ii was responsible for demonstrating band rejection
‘Alter to ter out specific equency range to show how the filter ean be sed to getrid of
‘unwanted frequencies. low pas filter and hgh pass filter were connected in parallel causing
attenuation at unwanted fequency range.
