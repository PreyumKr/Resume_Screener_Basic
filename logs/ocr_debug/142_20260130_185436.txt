Bachelor of Arts: Criminology
Criminology, as a field, explores
the nature and causes of crime.
Criminology also examines the
impact crime has on society and
how in turn society responds to the
social problem of crime. The
Bachelor's degree in Criminology
will emphasize the study of types,
patterns and trends in criminal
behavior; the social etiology of
crimes and the social response to
crime and its effect on society.
The program will also train
students to analyze crime data,
test explanations of crime and
victimization, and critically
evaluate crime theory and policy.
The Criminology program is
appropriate for students wishing to
pursue career paths in all justice
related fields including: law
enforcement; probation and
parole; community based
prevention and control programs;
court based programs; and
corrections. Because our program
provides for a broad knowledge of
the nature and trends of crime and
an understanding of crime control
policy along with methodological
and critical thinking skills, our
students will be prepared to
assume positions of leadership
across a range of career paths in
crime and justice related
professions, as well as be prepared
for post-graduate studies in
Sociology, Criminology, and Law
and Legal Studies.
