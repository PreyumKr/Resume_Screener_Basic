a single user interface with variant login ids of banks that is created through LDAP server.

accounts. Now to access the Strataweb application a user profile id is created through master application called SAM. This same user
profile is then pointed through LDAP to access CAFE application server. Hence testing involves checking same functionality in old
Strataweb application and in CAFE to find that the integration is done well
