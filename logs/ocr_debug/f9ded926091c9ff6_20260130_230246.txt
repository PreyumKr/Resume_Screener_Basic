Dear [Hiring Manager’s Name],

Recently, my former colleague was hired by [Target Company] as a member of the IT
Department, and said that [Target Company] was looking for additional members to join
their team. [Target Company] has a reputation of being an excellent place to work, as
well as being a place to challenge people well-versed in IT. I thrive under pressure and
embrace new challenges, and think I would make a great addition to the company.

Working in IT requires both technical knowledge and the ability to concisely
communicate with people. As an IT Support Analyst for Bain Consultants, I was
frequently engaged in software support for our clients, who I promptly and efficiently
helped with a diverse array of problems. I also assisted in implementing a new program
that streamlined service tickets, further boosting our Resolution Rate by 15%. In my
current IT Consultant role, I’ve successfully headed numerous projects with budgets
exceeding $2 million, while simultaneously providing topflight tech support and
infrastructure maintenance.

[Target Company] aspires to boost efficiency in their IT department. I have a track
record of doing so, and would be ecstatic to add my experience to the team. Regardless
of my role on [Target Company]’s IT staff, I am excited by the opportunity to get on
board and help achieve any short-term and long-term goals.

I would love the opportunity to come in for an interview and further discuss how I can
immediately contribute to the company. Please contact me at [PHONE] or via email at
[EMAIL] so we can arrange a suitable time to meet. Thank you for your consideration, I
look forward to hearing back from you.

Sincerely,
Your Name
