Work History

4Front Ventures — Worcester, MA.

Tve been growing cannabis for over 10 years and have been providing for patients in the Oregon Medical Marijuana Program since
2014. My preferred growing style is organic no-till methods using dry amendments and compost teas to create a truly unique
medicinal product for my patients. Growing different strains to meet the needs of my patients and then providing options for
different extractions, lotions and potions depending on each persons ailments/preferences. The ability to make my own schedule and
and fulfill goals on my own projects has really taught me about following through and being consistent to reach those goals. Having
my own grow through the years has really allowed me to make my own mistakes and sharpen my tools to have wide range of
cannabis knowledge. Iam currently providing for three patients, growing primarily outdoor in raised beds and a few indoor harvests

in the off season,

Eugene Wole Sale Nursery - City, STATE

I worked side by side with the company owners and 2-3 other farm hands to grow, harvest, and sell trees on 100 acres. We provided
fruit trees and ornamentals of all strains to locals and larger bulk buyers around the country. I pruned and trained center branching
for straighter trees, clean and hoe fields, pot trees, fix water lines, equipment and building maintenance, move water pipe, clone
plants, plant seed, spray for pests, drive tractor and operate farm equipment, fertilize. Every tree sold is from seed, clone, or grafting
done by us, other than a few specialty strains that are sourced out for genetics and planted at clone cutting stage. This job requires a
great deal of physical endurance, quick learning, and a green thumb to become efficient in everyday tasks. It was also a great
experience to see how a large scale (non-cannabis) agricultural operation does there perpetual cycles and overall upkeep of the plant
maintenance/rotation to provide for a demanding and competitive marketplace. Taught me a lot about how other plants grow and

how similar applications may cross over into cannabis industry.
