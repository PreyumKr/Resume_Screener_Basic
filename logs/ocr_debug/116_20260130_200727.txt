ACCOMPLISHMENTS,

Organization and efficiency are of utmost importance to me. Because of this I have developed a process of documenting and cataloging that
allows for quick re-assignment of projects. I wrote the training and policy manual for Cash Fast, Inc that allowed for cross employee training. I
also mapped and documented with full descriptive detail all the database designs I did for North Platte Natural Resources. I have automated
many processes and work flows to help organize digital documentations using Sharepoint and Visual Basics programming for more intuitive

locating, and to line up with physical filing.
