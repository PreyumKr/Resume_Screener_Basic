‘Work History

Led $80M grassroot capital project from design, development, and execution through start-up by serving as the Lead process design, HAZOP

lead, EPC engineering design manager, field engineer, start-up engineer, and systems turnover manager.

Continuously challenged design to deliver $11M capital efficiency; optimized metallurgy and spare equipment, challenged vendor provided

skids, rationalized internal design standards, redesigned plot area, and mitigated >$250k/day opex by optimizing flow path without facility

modifications

Lead commissioning and performance verification during start-up, development of performance test and acceptance plans, Operations

procedure development, technical training, transient HAZOPs, and systems tumover to ensure safe and timely start-up.

Managed vendor relationship, execution contractor safety performance, and construction oversight, developed and implemented management

of change procedures, punch list tracking, and led pre-startup safety reviews of systems

Served as technical project manager throughout the project - frequently worked with internal and extemal business partners, contractors, and

vendors to optimize performance, mitigate efficiency issues, and resolve day to day conflicts throughout construction and start up - mitigated 4

month delay by providing alternative design to eliminate environmental regulation conflict

Project Development and Process Design Engineer
ExxonMobil — City, STATE

Lead process designer on 10+ capital projects - $70M portfolio delivering $9M in capital efficiency. Responsible for development and design of
‘projects to reduce operating expenses, provide margin production benefits, and mitigate safety findings: FEED deliverables, equipment sizing,
risk assessments, MOC, and HAZOPs

Responsible for overall design, development and tracking of cost/schedule, mitigation of compressed schedules, and development of deviation
and change control procedures

Continuously challenged investment requirement; lead re-risk assessment efforts to challenge additional facility requirements associated with
liquid overfill (65.2M/y1), eliminated unjustified re-rates scope by reevaluating hydraulics ($400k), optimized T/A scope to deliver projects 5+
months ahead of schedule.

‘Types of projects designed: Water chemical treatment, Cooling towers, Fumaces, Condensate system, Tankage, Fire Protection, Liquid
Overfill, Tower Optimization, BLEVE mitigation, HAZOP Follow-ups, Operations cost reductions, Unit Debottlenecking

+ Established project schedules and monitored tasks to meet milestones during each phase.

* Drove operational improvements which resulted in savings and improved profit margins.

Regional Capital Project Development Lead, 01/2015 - Current
ExxonMobil - City, STATE
* Responsible for the development of capital projects from design development through startup; developing resource plans, schedules, and
project delivery for all optimization and FEED phase activities of $3Bn regional capital project portfolio.
* Developed new design work process to deliver 7% on average savings for small capital projects (<$25M)
«Improved systems tumover and startup work processes for regional capital project portfolio to ensure facilities are appropriately handed
over to the operating organization.
* Provides process design and project development technical leadership and training to younger engineers
* Leading development of work process updates; best practice and design standard rationalization, start-up procedure guidance, FEED
deliverables, project integration to site, and management of change procedures.
+ Provides technical recommendation on fit-for-purpose project plans and responsible for updating internal road map to reflect alternative
project path options; skipping gates, reducing deliverables, overlapping project stages..etc. to meet project deadlines §
