PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE
Fraczat, INc., Toledo, Ohio 2005 - Present
‘Mechanical Design Engineer
Collaborate with product developers and engineers to develop and operationalize state-of-the-art
alternative power plant concepts for automotive applications.
Research and review existing technologies based upon target markets; apply design analysis, FEA
process, and non-linear engineering concepts to create plans. Coordinate with suppliers / vendors and
internal engineering resources to obtain prototype parts and equipment; define functional, dimensional,
and visual requirements for components. Evaluate and demonstrate manufacturing feasibility and
technical justification for design approach; conduct design validation. Maintain comprehensive
documentation of complex design activities.
= Doubled life of liquid hydrogen in vehicle-mounted tanks in collaboration with Chemical Engineers
during design of hydrogen re-uptake and sublimation reclamation system,
= Conceived, designed, and prototyped a light-weight infinitely variable transmission (IVT) for use
with hydrogen fuel cell engines, resulting in 6% improvement in fuel efficiency.
‘+ Played integral role in patent-pending electric motorcycle concept combining miniaturized IVT with
regenerative braking
= Developed low-weight, low-frction piston assembly for ai-pressure vehicle (air car), increasing top
speed of prototype by 11% with no decrease in range.

GAD Transmissions, Detroit, Michigan 2001 - 2004
