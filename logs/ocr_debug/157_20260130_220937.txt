COVID-19 SUPPORT TEAM AND PRE-OP TESTING 05/2020 to 07/2020

Christiana Care Health System | Carneys Point, NU

During this pandemic, when everything was on quarantine and the state was shut down, all elective surgeries
were halted and rescheduled. This was for about 2 months. After the state was opened, CDC required all
hospitals to have every elective surgery patient test for COVID-19 before their surgeries. | was in charge of
calling patients to get their tests scheduled prior to surgery as well as answer any COVID-19 related
questions they may have had. They had to have these tests done exactly 3 days before surgery so it was
imperative that we called these patients and went above and beyond to get them in to have surgery in time. If
they did not get these done then their surgeries were to be rescheduled
A lot of patients did not reside in Topeka, and they would have to drive very far to get this done. Several
requested that they get their testing done at a hospital or clinic setting that tested for COVID-19. | would
communicate with these out-of-network providers to ensure that we get their test completed and the results,
sent to us so that they can have these surgeries in time.

I called patients daily to get on schedules. | would keep in touch with their primary care providers so they are
aware of what testing needs done prior to surgery,

Asked patients what symptoms they may have that are COVID-19 related, so that | can assure the safety of
our employees as well as other patients and themselves before they came to their surgeries.

Communicated with the COVID-19 team and hotline to ensure patient safety, as well as ensure the quality of
care was satisfactory.
