ApprTIonaL INFORMATION

 

Growing up in Indonesia as the son of missionaries, I attended Central Java Inter-Mission School (now, Mountainview International Christian
School) in Salatiga. My formative educational experience happened under the guidance of teachers and an institution that had an abiding faith
in God and the the transformational power of Jesus Christ. I would deeply appreciate the opportunity to allow my faith in the revolutionary
power of the cross to inform and infuse all aspect of my teaching practice. I seek to emulate the fine example made manifest in the lives of the
teacher that taught me at CJIMS. [ believe this is the kind of ministry that God has interwoven into the fibers of my very being
